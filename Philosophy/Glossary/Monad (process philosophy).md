Monads are ordered sequences of states of affairs consisting of the co-exemplification of properties during some period of time. But monads are not static: they are endowed with an inherent “active force” that engenders the transitions between states. Moreover, since Leibniz took temporal relations to be “founded” in the properties of monads, states of monads are _per se_ not temporally discrete.[[1](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/notes.html#note-1)]
