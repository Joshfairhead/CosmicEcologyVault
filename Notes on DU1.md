3) Relational knowledge is the part seperated from whole.
4) Substantial / Value knowledge is to know one self as part
	- The realization that one may know as much as one pleases, but that it is useless if one does not know what matters, is the shock that makes possible the arising of subsistential knowledge
5) Potential or Effectual knowledge is where one sees potential as real, AND SELECTS ONE EVENT to actualise from amongst several through a sacrifice of potential.
6) 
7) **to know means to know all, including the place of each part in relation to the whole**, its actual and potential destiny, and the means whereby the cosmic purpose in any given occasion can be fulfilled. True knowledge is effectual not merely for the particular whole within which it is lodged, but for the ordering of the universal process. The possessors of true knowledge are themselves both creators and also regulators
	- True knowledge is not absolute knowledge nor even final knowledge, for it is limited by the level of being and the form of will with which it is associated.
	- Knowledge can be true, self-evident, and self-verifying, and yet be confined within the limits of a given whole. When it is present, the functions of that whole are completely harmonized and well-ordered. There is a complete adaptation of the inner and the outer worlds. This brings with it right action and also the power to create order and to disseminate it.
8) According to the principle of structure, the step from the seventh to the eighth gradation is an act of completion that requires a fresh shock. 

3.7.1 The Meaning of 'Impossibility'
- 'There is a round square.' - logical framework
- 'yesterday's sun will rise tomorrow' - dependent on conscienciouss
- framework is neither what things do nor what they are, but the form in which—being what they are—they do what they do
- Rules are no more than formulae, the value of which is to be assessed only in terms of their pragmatic effectiveness. Laws are the statement of objective regularities that are presumed to be independent of our search and of its success or failure.
- The laws of framework prescribe the general conditions which make it possible for situations to enter experience. Rules tell us whether a given situation can be an occasion.

3.7.3 The Search for Universal Laws
- Phenomena are not identical with events in time and space. They have a coherence that we discover when we examine them from the standpoint of universal similarity.
- This similarity concerns the different ways in which phenomena can be classified, and also the connection that can be found between the classes.
- The task of the logician and the mathematician is to bring clarity and coherence into the discoveries that we all make, even without noticing them, about the form of all possible situations; that is, about framework.<sup>2</sup> In this respect the determining-conditions of framework differ from the generalizations of natural science. 
- We therefore can answer the question, 'Are there alternative logics ?' by saying that there are as many logics as there are fundamental categories of our experience. There is the two-term logic of wholes and polarity, the three-term logic of the triad, and so on.
- **Taking the view, as we must, that future occasions are no less part of our experience than present or past occasions, then we must admit probability as part of the framework of phenomena.** We thus find how to reconcile the fiducial and confidence theories of probability. 
- This pattern discloses two sets of conditions: one set determines the potentialities of the situation, and the other the frequency with which a particular potentiality will be actualized. These two sets of conditions are independent of both existence and behaviour and yet both are universal; for no situation is fully determined without reference to its potentialities and their likelihood of occurrence.


3.7.5. Framework as the Condition of Possibility
- Framework is the totality of universal conditions that, applied to any and every situation, determines whether it is possible or impossible.
- The laws are the limitations placed upon the arbitrariness of phenomena by the form of our own human consciousness

3.7.6. The Four Determining-conditions of Framework
- If we take existence and behaviour together, we can speak of time as the determining-condition that sets existence against the background of behaviour, and of space as that which sets behaviour against the background of existence.
- The connection between this interpretation and that of Kant can be seen if we remember that existence is experienced as consciousness—that is, 'inner intuition', and behaviour as knowledge—that is, 'outer intuition'. Laws from which both behaviour and existence can be abstracted are those of pure will. They correspond to the conditions already designated by the word hyparxis.
- the partition between the four groups of laws is sharp only in the domain of inanimate objects.
- 'Space' and 'hyparxis' are not words of either kind, for they signify neither what anything is nor what it does.* The former is the outer and the latter is the inner condition of 'being what one is'. 
- Time, eternity, and hyparxis are conditions of being what one is, whereas space is the condition of not being what one is not. The first three are inner conditions and they are intrinsically similar in character in so far as they do not relate. Space is an outer condition and its chief significance is in relations.

3.8.1. Framework as the Self-limitation of Will
- Although this appeal to experience is a necessary safeguard, the general character of the determining-conditions can best be established by reference to the fundamental triad
- Since we can never reach a complete understanding of the laws in their ultimate objectivity, we are compelled to make our own subjective rules for dealing with phenomena as they arise.
