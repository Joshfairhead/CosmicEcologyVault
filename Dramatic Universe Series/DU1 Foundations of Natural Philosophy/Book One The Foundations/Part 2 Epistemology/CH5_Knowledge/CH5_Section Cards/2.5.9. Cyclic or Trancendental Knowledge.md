The sixth category endows experience with the power of reconciling dependence and independence. Each whole returns upon itself— closing its own cycle—and, at the same time and by the same means, enters into, and becomes linked with, all other wholes completing and closing their own cycles. In passing from the fifth to the sixth gradation, knowledge transcends the distinction of actual and potential by penetrating into that region where actual and potential are incessantly interchanged and interwoven. Knowledge of this kind must always escape from the limitations of any particular experience; for the closed cycle can neither know itself nor know another, except by way of self-transcendence. 

Transcendental knowledge means knowledge that cannot be given in the data of sense-experience alone. The senses do not perceive the return of cycles into themselves. Although by the sixth principle everything that exists must be composed of vibrations, the senses perceive either a movement that is not recurrent—like that of the sun across the sky, or a quality that does not move—like a musical sound or a colour. To perceive in everything the return of cycles is to go beyond effectual knowledge into a region where the ultimate reality already begins to make itself felt. The sixth stage of knowledge is thus dominated by the end rather than by the beginning; yet it lacks one essential element by which knowledge becomes self-evident—that is, self-verifying. Everywhere transcendental knowledge makes itself felt in the mutual adaptation of cycles in every manifestation of the universal existence. It is only our ordinary human thought—remaining abstract and ineffectual—that is unaware of the universal rhythms. Even where such knowledge is apparently acquired, it is, nevertheless, abstract and subjective, whereas transcendental knowledge is direct participation in the universal return; it is the discovery of the self in everything, and the recognition of one pattern underlying all the diversity of phenomena.
