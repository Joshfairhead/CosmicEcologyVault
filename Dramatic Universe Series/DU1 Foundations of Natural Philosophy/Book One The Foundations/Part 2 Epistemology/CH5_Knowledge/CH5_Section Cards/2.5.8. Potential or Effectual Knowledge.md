Value knowledge alone does not ensure appropriate action for the attainment of that which is known as possessing value. For this it is necessary to separate again from the experience of knowledge in order to set it against the background of non-knowledge. The fifth gradation can be called either knowledge of potentialities or effectual knowledge. It produces the greatest intensity of action between the functional centres. Whereas in the fourth gradation the knower can make a right assessment of the data presented to him, he remains closed to the hidden possibilities. The fifth gradation is an opening of himself to what might be, and hence it is connected with sensitivity. He then begins to know the ungiven as well as the given. There is in this knowledge the polarity of actual and potential that produces a force and, because the knowledge is objective, the resulting action is effectual. Until this gradation is reached, there is in all knowledge a blind spot; namely, that which is unable to see the hidden potentialities â€”thus obliging the subject either to infer or to guess. With the fifth gradation, potentialities may become no less apparent than actualities. Since there has to be a choice of the kind that involves sacrifice in order that out of many potentialities one event should become actual, the fifth gradation of knowledge is one of maximum tension.<sup>1</sup> It stands midway between the ultimate knowledge that is accessible only by way of revelation and the primitive knowledge that is present in every whole, irrespective of its perfection or imperfection. In effectual action there is always a step in the dark, for all the potentialities can never be known. On the other hand, where there is no knowledge of potentialities at all, all action is blind. In human experience, authentic effectual knowledge is very rare, and yet, by reason of its sensitivity, it is the condition of all innovation and of all creative activity. 

It must be understood that the natural order requires that effectual knowledge should be present wherever a cosmic function is to be performed. In nutrition and reproduction there is effectual knowledge of food and sex. In eating there is not only a relationship and a knowledge of existence, but also a functional adaptation that takes into account the possible transformations of food as well as the immediate experience. Thus we see that even at the fifth gradation of knowledge there are different levels, but the quality of the experience is the same throughout. It is the operation of a force that brings the actual and the potential into a sharp contrast with one another and issues in an act that is both causal and purposive. **An examination of the conditions required for effectual action will show that there are always five distinctive elements present; namely, three to establish a relationship, a fourth to introduce a discrimination of values and a sense of existence, and a fifth factor that takes into account the latent potentialities.**

"A priori knowledge can no longer be restricted to 'necessity', it refers to 'potentiality' and to 'probability' as well. In short the two realms of knowledge are not monomorphic but polymorphic."]
