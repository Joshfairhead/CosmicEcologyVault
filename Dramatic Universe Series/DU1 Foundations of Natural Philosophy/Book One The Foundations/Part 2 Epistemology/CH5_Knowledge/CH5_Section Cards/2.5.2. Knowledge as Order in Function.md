Let us agree that some meaning can be ascribed to the words 'the key knows its own lock'. They have something in common with such a sentence as 'I know my own front-door'. When we use the word 'know' in such a context, the idea of correspondence is not far from the surface of our thought. In the first sentence, the correspondence between the pattern of the key and the wards of the lock is almost the only element of knowledge present. The second is more complex, but we are certainly referring to the correspondence between a pattern of memories and habits and the configuration of the houses and the street in which we live. 

In the act of making a new key, we take a blank and file it away until the required pattern is actualized. Out of the undiscriminated multitude of possibilities inherent in the blank we have selected one and excluded the remainder. Similarly, if we examine the various forms of knowledge that we meet within our experience, we can see that there is always a like process of selection and arrangement in order to bring about a correspondence between two different wholes. 

We thus revert to the relationship between knowledge and behaviour that we have already noted. We can say—in the broadest sense—that the knowledge present in any whole is a set of correspondences between its inner patterns and those of other wholes with which it reacts. If there is no such connection, knowledge is trivial and ineffectual, and produces no significant consequences. 

The converse proposition—namely, that knowledge is in itself the guarantee of appropriate response—is obviously untrue. There are three reasons for the possible failure of knowledge to evoke such response. Firstly, there may be its own functional inadequacy; that is, the imperfect correspondence between the pattern of cognition and the pattern of perception. Secondly, there may be a lack of being-intensity, by reason of which knowledge may lapse from consciousness and therefore be useless. Thirdly, there may be defects of will, which may prevent the requisite form of process from being actualized. Knowledge alone can only give automatic adaptation, and this is by no means always 'appropriate' to the situation. 

There is no qualitative difference between the knowledge present in a man and that present either in an animal or in an inanimate mechanism. We can confirm that this is so by examining the process whereby the growth of knowledge goes beyond the mere accumulation of random traces of past impressions. We can establish that in every whole—living or non-living—there is a more or less developed form of memory. This has been proved experimentally by J. L. Bose, and subsequently confirmed by many other investigators. In his classical investigation, Bose showed how the response-mechanism of inorganic bodies has fundamental features in common with that of plants and animals. These features include fatigue under continuous stimulation, hysteresis, and the reversal of response under the action of stimulants and depressants.<sup>1</sup>

In vertebrate animals—and especially in man—the registration and ordering of sense-impressions takes place in the grey matter of the brain. There are two distinct ways in which this can occur. In one case, impressions may collect in the neural schemata solely by repetition of similar impressions. These, being revived in the memory by association only, need have no objective reference, and hence no bearing upon effectual behaviour. The ordering process in such a case usually ceases at this point, and there is no subsequent development.<sup>2</sup> The received impressions are preserved as information and no more than this. In the other case, if the impressions are confronted with previously noted experience, especially if they are tested by an effort of attention—that is, by reflection—they become part of a coherent structure, available to promote successful action. 

Knowledge, in both senses, is order; but reflective knowledge has the special property of relating the inner order to the outer, and for this reason it can promote effectual—albeit automatic—action. Thus it becomes apparent that the acquisition of knowledge involves a special relationship, in which the registration of sense-impressions is only one component of a triad. We do not usually suspect how small a part reflection plays in our actions; but the man who reflects, and strives to relate the new impressions to the structure of his previous experience, saves himself from the chaos of disordered information. Even instinctive knowledge, acquired apparently without struggle by the individual, is nevertheless the fruit of the functional strivings of innumerable generations of remote ancestors. It is this reflective character that we express by defining knowledge as the ordering of function. Randomness—that is, disorder—arises spontaneously; but ordering requires a specific strain or effort.<sup>3</sup> 

The potential functions of a man go far beyond either his mental associations or his bodily behaviour, and the ordering of function as a whole can surpass the result of training each group of functions taken separately. For example, we train our thinking brain to clear and logical thought; we seek to discipline our emotional reactions; we exercise our bodies in order to develop their powers; but, for the most part, we overlook the importance of achieving a harmony and a balance as between the several functions to enable them to work together as one whole. Without such harmony and balance there can be no valid knowledge. In order to know the meaning of our experience we need to think what we feel and to feel what we think. In addition, thoughts and feelings must be brought into harmony with the instinctive and motor functions before we can come to any completeness of knowledge. There is a further limitation upon knowledge; namely, that it is a relationship of one to many. The order present within a single whole has to correspond to an immense number of other wholes, and to a still greater number of possible combinations of these. It is trite to say that we can only know a small fraction of what is knowable, but we must remember that this also means that our behaviour can correspond only to a small fragment of the situation present to our experience. Even that small fragment can only be imperfectly known, because it is apprehended from the limited—and possibly very narrow—perspective of our own localization in time and space. Our knowledge of the fragment may lead us to action very different from—even directly opposed to—that which we would see as appropriate if we had knowledge of a larger whole. For instance we may refuse to drink a bitter medicine, because we know that this would result in an immediate unpleasant sensation, while remaining ignorant of its necessity for our future well-being. Such a picture is symbolic of the whole situation of man. We cannot discover the sense and meaning of our own existence unless we can see it upon a sufficiently large scale. The question 'What are we to make of our life?' turns in the first place upon the possibility of knowing the degree of correspondence that could exist between the pattern of our personal history and the pattern of the great cosmic process in which we are involved.<sup>4</sup>

<sup>3</sup> The argument here turns upon the connection between order and probability. As Boltzmann has shown, the degree of order present in a system is inversely proportional to the logarithm of its probability, and perfect order is therefore infinitely improbable.
