We have noticed that knowledge cannot exteriorize itself in order to apply some objective criterion of truth to its own content. This is strictly the case only when applied to knowledge as the regulating factor in automatic behaviour; that is, when it is without inner discriminations. We have to qualify this statement when we take account of the relativity of being. 

Let us consider a few examples which will show that there can be knowledge that is authentic, although of a primitive, non-discriminative character. A man sets out in his car to drive to a familiar destination. He performs a series of complicated co-ordinated actions over a period of half an hour or so. These include starting and driving the car, selecting and following the correct route, and a whole sequence of adjustments to the movements of pedestrians and of other vehicles. Let us assume that the man is deeply preoccupied with some question unconnected with his driving or with the road he follows to his destination. He does not, as it is said, 'give a thought' to his driving, but nevertheless he arrives successfully and punctually at the end of his journey. His sensory and motor functions have performed a task which, if analysed in terms of all the separate adjustments between the internal and external situations, would prove to be immensely complicated.

If we ask in what respect do the actions of this man differ from those of someone who could not drive very well and who had not previously made the same journey, we would probably answer that the first man 'knows' how to drive and 'knows' the way, whereas the second does not 'know' how to drive and has little 'knowledge' of the route. What, then, is this 'knowledge' ? We find that it consists almost entirely of a store of previously experienced sense-impressions, arranged and connected with each other in a certain way, and, moreover, that 'knowledge' of this kind is authentic and can be effectual without intellectual awareness of the process by which it is acquired or used. 

Consideration of a familiar minor episode will provide further data. A dog sleeping on a hearth-rug is bitten by a flea and scratches himself with his hind-leg without waking. In some sense, he can be said to 'know' that the scratch-reflex will relieve the irritation. This 'knowledge' is not registered in his head-brain, because the reflex persists even if the dog is decerebrate; that is, if the brain connection is severed from above the thalamus. Knowledge of this primitive kind need not depend upon any prior experience of the organism concerned; it is transmitted by heredity and forms part of the innate instinctive-reflex mechanism; and, indeed, far more complicated patterns of instinctive behaviour are somehow 'known' without any prior sense-experience from which the 'knowledge' could have been acquired. 

Simple authentic knowledge, resembling instinct, can also be acquired from experience. Lloyd Morgan has described experiments with a new-born chick that is offered a diet of pleasant-tasting, wholesome maggots mixed with bitter, poisonous lady-birds. The chick, after one or two unpleasant experiences, ceases to peck at the bitter-tasting lady-birds.<sup>1</sup> In a general definition of knowledge, we are bound to say that the chick now 'knows' the difference between lady-bird and maggot; and so makes a distinction in place of the single undifferentiated reaction to every small bright object lying on the ground. 

It would not be easy to define knowledge in such a way as to exclude the elementary discrimination of the chick while yet admitting the complex discrimination of the driver of the car in the first example. It is by no means necessary that consciousness of self, or even the most diffuse self-awareness, should accompany this knowledge. It would not be difficult to construct a feed-back that would display the same behaviour pattern as the chick's. Such a mechanism need not be designed in advance to respond differently to the two kinds of stimulus, but could itself 'learn' to discriminate through repeated experiences of success and failure. The new science of cybernetics<sup>2</sup> has shown how the feed-back by which this result is achieved is much the same with the machine as it is with the living organism. The feed-back mechanism consists in relieving the strain that arises between the whole concerned and its environment. Moreover, the peculiar property of knowledge is that the relieving of the strain does not diminish, but rather increases, the possibilities of more complex actualization in the future. The chick that ceases to peck at the poisonous lady-birds not only relieves a present discomfort, but secures the possibility of growing up to lay eggs or to crow upon the dung-hill. Ernst Mach described how the discovery of what appeared to him a convincing account of sense-experience resulted in setting him free from the greatest intellectual discomfort of his life.<sup>3</sup> The ordering process—the relief from strain—is not knowledge itself, but is the mechanism whereby knowledge is acquired. This same mechanism is present at all levels and is that which leads us to strive—though it may be unconsciously—to know the world in which we live. 

The possibility of non-discriminative knowledge is not limited to human or even animal experience. We can conceive a well-prepared card-index—containing in readily accessible form knowledge of any subject, more detailed and more accurate than the greatest specialist could boast—which could, in theory, be fitted with a feed-back mechanism that would enable it to write intelligent replies to a great variety of questions. 

A final example will illustrate the manner in which the word 'knowledge' can be defined so as to give it a meaning that is universal and applicable to all occasions, inanimate as well as animate. In the growth of a crystal from a solution, the molecules of the solute arrange themselves in a definite way at the surface of the growing crystal. They do so by a mechanism which unmistakably has something in common with that which produces the scratch-reflex of the dog, the successful driving of a car, or the discovery of radium. In all cases there is a transition from disorder to order in the functional actualization. C. N. Hinshel-wood recognizes that the ordering process is common to living and non-living matter, though he does not deny that life may have some characteristic other than the creation of order which the non-living matter cannot reproduce; and in another passage he emphasizes the absence of adaptation.<sup>4</sup>

<sup>2</sup> The term cybernetics was coined by Norbert Wiener from the Greek word for a helmsman. The hypothesis of cybernetics was discussed by J. O. Wisdom, Brit. Journ. for Phil, of Sc., Vol. II, No, 5, pp. 1-22: "Cybernetics does not, of course, show that human beings are machines. Many thinkers would hold that they are, but the important question concerns the kind of machine they are likely to be." Wisdom concludes that the cybernetic model is inadequate, but that it is possible that mechanisms as yet undiscovered may be found that will approximate more closely than feedbacks to the working of the brain. Cf. also N. Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings (Chap. 7), for a discussion of the philosophical implications of cybernetics.

<sup>4</sup> Cf. C. N. Hinshelwood, Structure of Physical Chemistry, p. 434: "The first problem on the physical plane to consider, is the creation of order by living things. Unstable and reactive substances are built up in reactions which go with a not inconsiderable increase of free energy, and the question has from time to time been raised whether, in the course of these happenings, something has directed them along paths other than those prescribed by the second law of thermo-dynamics. This, however, is no more so than it is in the growth of a crystal, where a regular geometrical lattice emerges spontaneously from a chaotic solution."
