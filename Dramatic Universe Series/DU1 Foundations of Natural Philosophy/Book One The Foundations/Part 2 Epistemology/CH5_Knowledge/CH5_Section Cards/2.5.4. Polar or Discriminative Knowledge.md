Non-discriminative knowledge means functional order that can issue only as automatic behaviour. Only where there is a distinction of quality can there be selection and adaptation. The power to recognize differences of quality demands a separation of consciousness. Without this, there cannot be a comparison of two functional orders with that suspension of judgment which is the prerequisite of choice. 

The gradation of knowledge in which two functional orders are simultaneously apprehended and compared can be called polar or discriminative. According to the principle of polarity, simple division into two orders can give rise to a force, but not to a relationship. In general, when two sets of orders are compared, one will present a higher degree of activity than the other, and will therefore stand towards the other as affirmation towards denial. There is thus an arising of the 'yes or no' that is one of the elements of choice. There is no true 'yes or no', however, unless there is a difference of quality, recognized and appreciated in a single moment of consciousness. This is discrimination, by which knowledge passes from automatic adaptation to selective response. 

Since passive adaptation is the vegetative state, we can also apply to non-discriminative knowledge the term 'vegetative' to distinguish it from selective or 'animal' knowledge. In general, all animal existence is polar; for here there is an interplay of causal and purposive factors that everywhere makes itself felt.<sup>1</sup> The animal is at one and the same time a causally determined physico-chemical mechanism and a living being, seeking—consciously or unconsciously—to realize an end or purpose. All true animal activity therefore requires the second kind of knowledge as well as the first. 

When translated into the human sphere, polar knowledge is chiefly concerned with the adaptation of means to ends, thus satisfying Dewey's definition of knowledge as "a belief that promotes success". Nevertheless, polar knowledge does not effectively relate its possessor to the object, and there remains the polar distinction of knower and known as well as the polar opposition of affirmation and negation. 

In this connection, it is worth noting one consequence of the absence of relatedness in polar knowledge. This is the experience of the comic or of the tragic. In our human life, we find occasions when there is a separation of forces without the possibility of an appropriate response. Affirmation and denial then both remain suspended, and we experience a state of tension that can be relieved only artificially by laughter or tears. This is the form of behaviour that issues as the reconciling force when we are confronted with the comic occasion that requires of us a denial that it would be absurd to make. In the tragic situation, on the other hand, there is also a suspension of forces in which the affirmation proves impossible owing to the absence of a reconciling or relating force. In the ordinary occasions of life, polar knowledge can be efficacious because there is usually available a course of action that can reconcile the opposing forces; as, for example, when we have to choose between present pain and future pleasure, or the reverse. Nevertheless, polar knowledge is always lacking in objective reference; that is, in the means of self-verification.

Unstable and reactive substances are built up in reactions which go with a not inconsiderable increase of free energy, and the question has from time to time been raised whether, in the course of these happenings, something has directed them along paths other than those prescribed by the second law of thermo-dynamics. This, however, is no more so than it is in the growth of a crystal, where a regular geometrical lattice emerges spontaneously from a chaotic solution."
