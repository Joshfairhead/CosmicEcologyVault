According to the principle of structure, the step from the seventh to the eighth gradation is an act of completion that requires a fresh shock. A completion is at the same time an act of relinquishment, and the eighth gradation of knowledge is only reached when all ordinary-knowledge is laid aside and abandoned and consciousness lies open to the light of revelation. Revealed knowledge is thus possible only for a complete individual. All lower gradations of existence lack the power to recognize and to accept the revelation even if they should happen to be direct witnesses of its manifestation. 

Revealed knowledge is not confined to religious experience, but may be encountered in the ordinary situations of life where there is on the one hand a sufficiently exhaustive preparation by way of functional effort, and on the other a realization that the goal is unattainable by these means. The essential feature of revealed knowledge is that it cannot be ascribed to any functional activity within the whole to whom it is given. In the moment of revelation, the barrier of separateness is broken down, and herein it is a characteristic of the eighth category which is both totality and unity. 

Since revealed knowledge is habitually associated in men's minds with religious beliefs, reference to it may appear to be out of place in the study of the principles of natural philosophy. Nevertheless, it has often been observed that the progress of scientific knowledge depends upon sensitivity to a process that is not reducible to thought or sensation.<sup>1</sup> 

Without revelation, there can be no consistency in the knowledge that is accumulated in the myriads of separate centres of consciousness and derived from quite independent sets of facts, arranged and ordered by separate functional mechanisms. We must therefore conclude that a full theory of knowledge can only be established when full account is taken of all the eight gradations herein discussed. It is further necessary to take into account the influence of consciousness in determining the level of knowledge within any particular gradation, and also the form of will that imposes upon each functional order its own special form of manifestation. Bearing all these requirements in mind, it is scarcely surprising that men fail to establish a simple consistent epistemology.

Newman, Mathematics and the Imagination, and the descriptions therein of the way in which the French mathematician, Henri Poincare", analysed the process of hypothesis formation: "The subliminal self is in no way inferior to the conscious self; it is not purely automatic; it is capable of discernment; it has tact, delicacy; it knows how to choose, to divine. What do I say? It knows better how to divine than the conscious self, since it succeeds where that has failed. In a word, is not the subliminal self superior to the conscious self? You recognize the full importance of this question."
