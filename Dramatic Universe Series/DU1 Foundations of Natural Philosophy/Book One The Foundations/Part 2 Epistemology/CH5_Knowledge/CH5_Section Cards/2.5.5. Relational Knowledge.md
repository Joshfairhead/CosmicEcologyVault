The appearance of relational knowledge coincides with the birth of understanding. It can arise only through experience, which enables one inner functional order to reconcile two others, either outer or inner. By knowledge of this kind, otherwise unrelated facts can be welded into a coherent system. Moreover, its effect upon behaviour is not to produce the primitive adaptation of 'yes and no', but discriminative choice. 

The triadic relationship can break through the polar barrier that separates the subjective and the objective experience of man. Relational knowledge stands at the mid-point between the knower and the known, participating in the character of both. It can be shared by those who possess appropriate means of communication in one of the forms of authentic language. Non-discriminative knowledge, on the other hand, has little significance valid outside the particular whole within which it resides. It cannot be communicated or shared. Polar knowledge is also incommunicable, for it depends upon a particular occasion to supply the third force. Even when it is apparently general in character, polar knowledge cannot escape from the immediate subjectivity of the being in whom it is present. 

The connection between relational knowledge and understanding can be seen if we examine the manner in which it is acquired. Whereas the more primitive forms of knowledge develop by simple addition of experiences—whether sense impressions or inner associations—relational knowledge requires the prior arising of polarity. By this means, the new and the old are confronted. There is a moment of criticism— of suspended judgment—which is not allowed to pass into an automatic response, because there is already present the reconciling experience that demands its own place in the triad. Consequently, the suspense of judgment is not automatic but conscious, and in this suspense there is not only an ordering of function but also an act of will. 

Relational knowledge should be normal for man, who is endowed with a threefold nature, each part of which is able to transmit one of the three forces in the triad. It cannot, however, arise spontaneously, as is the case with knowledge of the second kind. Therefore, it can only appear in those beings in whom some measure of understanding has already been attained. A relationship in the true sense is like the gold of the alchemists, that cannot be produced unless some trace of gold is already present. **Man seeking to acquire relational knowledge must observe two rules: the first consists in suspending judgment so long as there is a possibility of doubt; the second requires that the reconciliation of contradictories should be pursued perseveringly, however difficult—or even hopeless —the task may appear.** The limitation of relational knowledge consists in its subjectivity. The triad itself does not establish the existence of the occasion. The step from indirect to direct knowledge can only be made when there is the power to participate, by which the knower is not only related to, but actually merges with, the known. This leads to the fourth gradation of existential knowledge.
