Subsistence is the first category of concreteness. To know subsistence is thus more than to know a relationship; it is the beginning of concrete knowledge as opposed to abstract knowledge. The latter is knowledge of the part separated from the whole, whereas the former is knowledge of any given object, not only in and for itself, but in and for a larger whole within which it finds its place and its significance. Knowledge of the fourth gradation therefore requires an active participation that is absent from the first three, even in their highest manifestations.

Generally speaking, the significance of subsistential knowledge is disregarded because the step from abstract to concrete experience is not understood. It is often assumed that the transition from abstract to concrete is the same as that from universal to particular, and that this step can be made without any change in the character of experience. This is a quite erroneous assumption; for recognition of existence is only possible if one exists oneself. For the most part, people 'know about' themselves in the same way as they 'know about' other things; that is, without the taste of what it means to exist. It is possible to know subjectively without knowing that one knows; objective knowledge begins only when there is self-knowledge. 

Knowledge of self is significant only when it distinguishes between different levels of experience within the same being. Self-knowledge is thus the condition prerequisite of value knowledge; for without it there can be no standards of comparison and therefore no discrimination of values.

The realization that one may know as much as one pleases, but that it is useless if one does not know what matters, is the shock that makes possible the arising of subsistential knowledge. Relational knowledge has a quality of completeness that polar knowledge lacks, but it does not suffice for the needs of existence. There evidently can be different degrees of intensity in subsistential knowledge, but it always conveys a feeling for values. Knowledge 'about' may leave us indifferent, but to know that a given whole is what it is can never have this result. In the subjective state of consciousness man is closed to the existence of the object he contemplates, whether it be his inner life or his outer world. 

Although subsistential knowledge is concerned with the being of its object, it is in the true sense knowledge and not consciousness or understanding. The power of subsistential knowledge is to bring about an order within the functions by connecting intellectual and physical apprehension with an emotional attitude. Out of this connection comes the moment of knowledge by which the experient himself undergoes a functional change. It must further be noted that the twelve categories of Chapter 2 prove inadequate for the expression of value knowledge.
