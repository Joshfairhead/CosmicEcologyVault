According to the principle of structure, every complete whole must have seven distinguishable qualities. The transition from the third to the fourth gradation of knowledge corresponds to that point at which the inner development of a process has exhausted its primary impetus, and can only acquire a new character with the help of a fresh impulse from an external source. The first three gradations of knowledge can all be called 'subjective', because the object of knowledge is placed outside the act of knowing. 

These three gradations can be specified as follows: 
(a) knowledge that leads to reaction, 
(b) knowledge that leads to discrimination, and 
(c) knowledge that leads to relationship. 

In terms of the triad, the first, non-discriminative, can be regarded as 'one-force' knowledge; the subject is passive—the active principle being the external impression or impulse, and the reconciling force being the general environmental conditions. In the same way polar knowledge can evidently be seen as 'two-force' knowledge; for the separation of active and passive principles then enters into the subject. Only with the third gradation do the three forces of the triad enter the subjective experience of the knower. 

Although we refer to three gradations of knowledge, it must be understood that it is only in a secondary sense that they are steps taken one after the other in order of time. Each gradation of knowledge has itself inner distinctions, and a very confused picture must inevitably result if these are not recognized. **Reactive knowledge can be very primitive—as in the ordering of the molecules on a growing crystal— but it can also be the means whereby a fully-developed being recognizes and accepts his own place in the universal order.**  Between these two extremes, there are gradations corresponding to the level of consciousness. **From this it follows that the growth of knowledge proceeds in at least two different dimensions—one corresponding to the progression of the categories and the other to the expansion of consciousness.** There is, however, also a third factor in knowledge which depends upon the will and can be termed 'the ableness to participate'. Knowledge can grow in two ways—one is by simple accretion like new entries in a card index. This does not lead to any change of quality. The transition to a different gradation is possible only with a corresponding change of consciousness and understanding. Thus the growth of knowledge as distinct from its mere accumulation cannot be an independent process. **The quality of knowledge depends primarily upon the quality of the knower; that is, the level of his being and the form of his will.** 

In order to express the different modes in which knowledge can be experienced, we commonly use such words as 'sensation', 'perception', 'cognition', 'intuition', 'inspiration', and 'illumination', the meanings of which usually remain undefined, or at best are defined with reference to some artificial theory of knowledge. In such definitions there is invariably a confusion of knowledge with elements that belong to consciousness and understanding. For this and other reasons, no consistent account of the limits and possibilities of human knowledge can be given without introducing a more exact classification, based upon experience that is not exclusively human. The absurdity of any attempt to reduce all knowledge to one—or to even a few—modes of thought can be seen if we reflect that there must be seven qualities of knowledge and that within each of these seven qualities there must be seven levels of consciousness; and also that each of the resulting forty-nine combinations will take different forms according to the seven possible manifestations of will.<sup>1</sup>

It is necessary to insist upon these distinctions in order to remove the suggestion that the first three gradations of knowledge characterize only the lowest levels of existence. The terms 'vegetative', 'animal', and 'human' knowledge represent distinctions applicable only to a particular type of functional experience—namely, that of multi-cellular organisms living on the surface of the earth—but they do not correspond to biological classes. It is, for instance, possible for a plant to have knowledge of a kind that is inaccessible to any animal or to a human being. There are many plants that have the power to synthesize substances possessing bio-chemical activity, such as the vitamins and the alkaloids—a power that requires a knowledge that no animal and very few human beings can acquire.<sup>2</sup>

A fundamental distinction has to be made between subjective and objective knowledge. This distinction arises because, according to the principle of structure, the transition between the third and fourth gradations is possible only with the help of an outside force. In all gradations of subjective knowledge there is the separation between knower and known, whereas in all gradations of objective knowledge this division is absent. Nevertheless, objective knowledge itself has quite different qualities according to the four steps that follow the first interval, or point of discontinuity. All knowledge is ordering of function; but whereas subjective knowledge can be acquired without change of being, objective knowledge arises through, and establishes, an essential change of both being and will in its possessor. Following the three gradations of subjective knowledge, we may specify five further gradations of objective knowledge as follows: 
(d) value knowledge, 
(e) effectual knowledge, 
(f) transcendental knowledge, 
(g) true knowledge,
(h) revealed knowledge. <sup>3</sup>
