The isolation of each human centre of experience or 'mind' from other 'minds' is one of the primary data of experience. There can be a more or less effectual interpenetration of functional activity, but there is little or no interpenetration of consciousness. It must be supposed that this isolation of consciousness is characteristic of our human situation and not of consciousness as a cosmic reality. Being, in its relativity, is compatible with forms of consciousness very different from ours—for example, it is possible that entities exist that though distinct in nature can, nevertheless, communicate by a merging of consciousness without the intervention of any functional activity as we know it. Even in human experience there occur rare moments when such a merging of consciousness appears possible. The fullest normal state of human consciousness is one in which a man is aware of his functional activity and the presence of an attention that directs it. Some such consciousness may be present also with the higher animals, though this must be even more rare. With the lower animals and inanimate objects we can safely exclude the presence of any awareness comparable to the attentive consciousness possible for man. 

Communication is therefore to be looked upon as a characteristically human problem—as psychological rather than metaphysical. Whether or not it is possible to know what is going on in other minds is a question of fact, to be decided by the same procedure as other questions of fact; namely, by observation, experiment, and analysis. We do not doubt that we can and do communicate with other minds, and we know, moreover, that communication is sometimes adequate and reliable; while at others it breaks down completely, and the sharing of experience proves impossible. Since communication is necessary in every situation where two or more human beings set out to achieve concerted action, the study of the conditions that make adequate communication possible is a general human need.

According to the third principle, every relationship requires three terms, and communication as the third term establishes a relationship between two centres of being-awareness, or two 'minds'. In discourse, for example, the speaker and hearer are related through the spoken word. Where the bodily functions are concerned, a gesture may take the place of words. Here communication is by imitation; by the arousing of a common emotional state; and also by direct action, as when one man will grasp another's arm to attract his attention. The form of communication that is chiefly important for natural philosophy is that which employs language. 

Language comprises all forms of communication in which a sign, symbol, or gesture stands for an object referred to, and the reference is recognized by the persons using it. A few definitions will help to clarify the distinction intended: 

**Language:** Communication between minds through the medium of some functional activity such as speech, writing, mathematical and logical shorthand, gestures, inflexions, rhythms, or pantomime. 

**Sign:** A sound with or without a corresponding ideographic mark that evokes in two or more people the memory of a recognizable simple experience. Hence the rule 'one referent—one sign'. 

**Symbol:** A sign that evokes in two or more people the memory of a connected group of distinct experiences differing not only in functional content but in the correlative states of consciousness. Hence the rule 'symbols are multivalent'. 

**Gesture:** A manifestation that evokes in two or more people the direct experience of the totality of all memories relevant to a given situation and produces a response of the will. 

**Linguistic Element:** A sign, symbol, or gesture is a linguistic element and speech is the art of combining linguistic elements for the communication of experience. 

Language, as the communication of experience, is to be distinguished from art and magic, which are also means of mutual action between people. In art there are also linguistic elements, but these do not merely stand for experience; for they are part of—and sometimes may be even the whole of—the experience that they represent. Through art, states of consciousness can be shared; the being content is primary and the functional is secondary. Similarly in magic there are linguistic elements, but these are used as a means of doing. Magic is an act of will, and the functional and being content of magic is subordinate to the will content.

In order to clarify further the role of language, we must make a distinction between direct and indirect communication. In all language, whatever may be its form, the communication is indirect; a sign, a symbol, or a gesture is not the object referred to, nor does it partake of its nature. This can be expressed approximately if we say the language is communication about; anything that can be referred to by means of a sign can be 'spoken about'. It is important to bear in mind, however, that since language is homogeneous with function, it can verify its reference only in so far as the object of discourse is functional; whereas communications about being and will, though made in functional language, cannot be verified by functional operations. Consequently, different forms of language are required for each of the three constituents of the fundamental triad of experience.

It must be emphasized that this theme is not 'linguistics' as commonly understood, but the multi-dimensionality language must acquire in order to be adequate for the three kinds of communication covering all the three aspects of experience.
