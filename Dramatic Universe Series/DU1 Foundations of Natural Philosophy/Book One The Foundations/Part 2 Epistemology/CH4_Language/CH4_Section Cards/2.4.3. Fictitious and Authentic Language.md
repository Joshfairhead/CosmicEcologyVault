The two main defects of language are lack of discipline and excessive specialization. Our spoken language has a certain wealth of content due to the shades of meaning that every spoken sentence acquires by vocal inflexion, rhythm, and bodily gesture. Nevertheless, it is an undisciplined language, and therefore useless for the purpose of establishing a common understanding of the deeper modes of experience, except for the rare cases where meanings can be verified by ostensive definition. Our ordinary language is full of recognized recurrences and hence of meaning, but it is vague and confused. On the other hand, specialized languages, though probably entailing a strict discipline, nearly always achieve precision at the expense of content, and so sacrifice the very meaning that they are seeking to convey. Fictitious language is for the most part that in which linguistic elements are used without verification in experience. The reference breaks down, and again meanings are lost. The problem of adequate communication arises in acute form when it is a question of sharing knowledge of non-functional experience. What we know is function, and there is no inherent obstacle to the sharing of functional knowledge. This knowledge is gained by observation—and we can observe ourselves in a way that is not fundamentally different from that in which we observe others—but it does not enable us to know human consciousness that can never be observed either in ourselves or in another. Language can never wholly bridge the gap that separates function and being, but communication about states of consciousness and acts of will is, nevertheless, possible. 

A vague realization of the different qualities of language has been responsible for the tendency to regard language as if it were mysterious. The truth is that, notwithstanding its varied resources, language always depends upon reference. We can speak about being, but we cannot communicate being. We can speak about acts of will, but we cannot communicate will itself. On the other hand, in our speech we can both speak about function and also communicate function. For speech is behaviour, and when used for communication, there is a correspondence in the behaviour-pattern of the speaker and the listener. The same applies to the writer and the reader of the written word, and to all other forms of language. 

Any criticism of language should start by exposing the vagueness and imprecision of ordinary usage. It must, however, be a constructive criticism, in the sense of building up to a more complete form of communication applicable to all forms and gradations of meaning. The aim must be to produce an authentic language having a sufficient variety of forms to enable all varieties of meaning to be communicated. 

Wherever there is effective communication there is an authentic language. Authentic language need not be specialized language. Much of the language of ordinary human discourse is authentic in so far as it relates to material objects and their functions. Domestic and economic life proceed more or less adequately through communications in which no criticism of the language used need arise. Here adequacy is achieved by the exigencies of the situation. This brings the words used into a direct relationship with the recurrent elements of experience from which they derive their meanings. Adequate communication is also achieved in scientific and technical discussions and texts. Here for the most part words are only used to designate a pattern of functional behaviour. Meaning in reference to the being of the entities to which they refer is neither sought nor attained. For example, we use the word 'electricity' to mean 'that unknown something which participates in the recurrent experience of electrical occasions'. Although restricted in their meanings, the signs used in such language can be effectual because the experiences to which they refer do, in fact, recur and can even for the most part be intentionally reproduced. 

The breakdown of ordinary language begins when we leave practical life for the discussion of abstract or philosophical questions. The fictions that serve well enough for communications about existence become sources of both deception and self-deception when we assign them uncritically to existence itself. We find, however, that with due care and using the method of progressive approximation, we can find words and sentences by which we can express and communicate our recognition of the categories of experience. 

The reconstruction of language in the domain of function is a relatively simple task that can be performed with the aid of the categories and principles of experience. The formation of language appropriate for communications about being and will is a task of a different order. We can, therefore, discuss the problem of language under five heads, the first of which consists in examining the defects of all spurious forms of language and various spurious linguistic constructions in which there is no effectual communication. The second is to ascertain why ordinary language can sometimes be used successfully. The next four consist in studying the requirements of the authentic languages of function, being, and will. 

The four forms of authentic language can broadly be described as follows: 

**(i) Mixed Language:** Words and sentences used in ordinary human intercourse without distinctions of meaning and successful only in a stable context. 
**(ii) Sign Language:** The language of philosophy; in which there is the effectual communication of simple meanings without shades of being-significance. 
**(iii) Symbolic Language:** Theoretical language; in which symbols are used with due regard to the relativity of meanings, permitting effectual communications regarding being-discrimination. 
**(iv) Gestural Language:** Practical language; in which effective communication is possible in all domains of function, being, and will, by the combination of all three types of linguistic element.
