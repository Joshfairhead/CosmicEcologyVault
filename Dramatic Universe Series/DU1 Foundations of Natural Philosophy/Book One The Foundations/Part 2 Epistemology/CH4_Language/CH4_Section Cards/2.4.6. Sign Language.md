One of the chief tasks of philosophy is to establish a stable context for the discussion of all questions of general interest to man. For this purpose it requires to assign meanings to certain elements of experience that are not directly given in sense-perception, but derive from a process of interpretation that sometimes is lengthy and complicated. 

A complete philosophical language is created only when those who intend to use it have established a context of experience in which all the necessary meanings can be recognized. 

We are concerned with human communications; that is, with the transfer of meanings from one mind or centre of consciousness to another by means of behaviour. Owing to the isolation of each centre of consciousness, it is not possible for any two to have exactly the same elements of experience, and therefore meanings can never coincide wholly and in every respect. When therefore we set down the requirement that each sign should have a single meaning, we must take into account the approximative character of the process of recognition and interpretation. 

The common stable context of discourse is only set up gradually by way of a recurrent process of 'trial and error'; that is to say, of experiment and verification. As compared with the mixed language of ordinary discourse, the true philosophical language can be both adequate and free from ambiguity. The construction of a system of unambiguous signs is, however, not a task to be taken as a preface to the use of philosophical language; on the contrary, it is in the process of communication combined with verification that signs can acquire an unambiguous, definite relationship to meanings. The task represents, nevertheless, an undertaking indispensable for effectual communication beyond the limitations of technical reference. As it progresses, effectual communication in regard to abstract topics becomes possible. Nevertheless, communication still remains functional in character, and does not go beyond the sharing of knowledge. 

A sign is the means of drawing attention to one definite group of similar experiences, and it is effectual only when there is a one-to-one correspondence between signs and the recurrent elements of experience. This is easily accomplished in regard to material objects such as tables and chairs, but it is only with difficulty and great care that the meaning of experiences for which we use such words as 'attention', 'memory', 'desire', 'hope' can be recognized and signified. All such words carry in the mixed language of ordinary speech chance suggestions and unverified assumptions that lead inevitably to misunderstanding. 

The elimination of superfluous elements from the meaning of a sign must not be carried out in such a manner as to deprive it of the generality required in philosophical discourse. We do not derive from our experience the knowledge that is possible, because we do not interpret; that is to say, we fail to bring together in our thought recurrent elements that are connected in fact. For example, we observe our own behaviour and find in it a variety of meanings, but not the overriding significance expressed in the sentence 'man is a machine'. We do experience, and that repeatedly, patterns of behaviour that consist in automatic reactions in which we have neither initiative nor choice, but we do not see the total significance of these observations, and we therefore use the sign 'man' to mean something which does not exist. 

One consequence of this failure to recognize the meaning of human experience is that almost all philosophical discussions of man and his place in the natural order are ineffectual. Knowledge of the kind that is required to bring the requisite depth of meaning into the signs used cannot be acquired without effort and discipline, and in general it is a work that must be shared with others. Recognition of functional recurrences can be transformed into valid knowledge only with the help of the categories. Nevertheless, the categories themselves are efficacious only in so far as we recognize their meaning in our own experience, and can share that meaning in a common context with others. They are the primary signs in terms of which the meaning of other signs can be expressed. Consequently the requirement of a stable context involves a smaller number of independent meanings than might have appeared. Our knowledge of the categories is at first slender and unreliable, and can grow only through the examination of experience and the communication of the results between those who seek to establish a common language. 

The categories are the basic linguistic elements. Each of them can serve as a sign, a symbol, or a gesture, according to the fullness of meaning that we can recognize in our experience. Their primary application consists in the formation of a valid and coherent system of philosophical signs. They can serve this purpose because they satisfy the canon of philosophical language that one sign could have one meaning. It must, however, be remarked that, approached in this manner, our knowledge of the categories is functional only. In so far as they refer to being and will, we can only 'know about' them. Signs do not serve to give us either consciousness or understanding. On the other hand, we regard function as co-extensive with all existence, and therefore functional signs must be available for any possible reference. With the help of an adequate philosophical language, we can refer to all levels of being and all manifestations of will$^1$ 
The powers, and also the limitations, of philosophical language derive from the use of unambiguous signs. In our ordinary mixed language we frequently use signs as if they were symbols and symbols as if they were signs. This gives ease and flexibility to the literary language; but these gains are at the expense of clarity and coherence. If a sign is to be admitted into philosophical language, it must be shorn of any symbolical associations and made to correspond to a definite concept. This latter is reached by the interpretation of experience; namely, the process by which a recurrent element is recognized and disengaged from its context. 

Thus, the process whereby a concept is formed is at the same time one whereby a sign acquires a meaning. In psychological terms the clarification of a sign and its meaning requires reflective attention by which it is constantly referred back to the context from which it derives its meaning. When we reflect upon such words as 'memory', 'hope', and 'effort', we can see that in ordinary language they are used as linguistic elements pointing towards an unclarified mass of experiences. To reduce such elements to signs demands a severe discipline that a man can, in general, practise only in solitude. Hard though this discipline is, it is manifestly insufficient for communication unless the participants in discourse can verify that each has carried through a similar procedure and has identified the same recurrent elements in experience from which the meaning of a given sign is derived. Successful intercourse requires, further, that reflective attention should be sustained in the act of communication, to ensure that the sentences used bear the meanings intended. When the written word is interposed between the participants, there is the added difficulty that sentences tend to take the character of symbols and evoke associations foreign to the intended meaning. 

There are, however, no inherent defects in the human functions that should prevent the construction of a philosophical language in which every important sign, whether written or used in verbal communications, would have a unique meaning. The current lack of such language is mainly due to the fact that the systems of education practised throughout the world are satisfied with technical reference and remain indifferent to meanings. Because of this indifference, educated people feel little or no discomfort when using words without bestowing any degree of attention upon the recurrent experiences to which they are presumed to refer, and without verifying that the hearer assigns the same, or indeed any, meaning to what he hears. It is evident that a rational education calls for the development of an unambiguous system of signs and a clear literary form. 

It must be understood that the formation of an authentic sign language is a most arduous undertaking. It demands from those who engage upon it an unflinching determination to reach effectual communication. There must also be a development of attention by which the recurrent elements in experience can be recognized and interpreted as the meanings of the signs employed. Finally, there must be discipline in the use of language; the integrity of signs must be preserved, and this can be achieved only at the price of constant vigilance. 

There can be philosophical language appropriate to psychology, to history, to natural science, to art, politics, and religion—and even to specific activities within any of these domains. It is not the subject-matter that distinguishes the philosophical language, but the possession of an adequate system of signs related to a common context of experience. It follows that each philosophical school must construct its own language for the purposes of the particular task in which it is engaged. Hence philosophical languages take diverse forms according to their origin. Nevertheless, wherever there are two or more authentic languages of signs, it is possible to translate from one into the other, because they are all derived by the same process of interpretation from recurrent elements in the common experience of mankind. We have, for example, formulated the categories according to our own discovery of meanings in all varieties of experience. The system so constructed is not closed to other systems, and through the discipline of reflective attention a correlation of meanings is possible. In this manner, all authentic philosophical language can be brought into a single scheme of unambiguous signs.

It does not, however, follow that the signs established by a philosophical discipline carry meanings that can be recognized from the sound, the form, the etymological derivation, or the common usage of the words employed. Signs do not carry their meanings on their sleeves, nor indeed any meaning at all, except for those who have created these meanings in a common effort to establish a stable context of experience. Those who wish to communicate by way of the language of signs must themselves acquire a co-ordination of functions that permits clear and unambiguous speech. 

Every element of experience that can be recognized is the source of a meaning, and every meaning can be represented by a sign. The language of signs can thus ideally be made adequate for communications respecting the meaning of all possible forms of experience. The relationship between meanings can be expressed by sentences; a properly constructed system of sentences is philosophical discourse. Wherever in our experience we can discover repeated and therefore recognizable elements, we have the possibility of philosophical discourse.


$^1$ We may note that the discussion has many features in common with that of Spinoza who—especially in the Ethics—defines three gradations of language, of which only the third is authentic by reason of its direct reference to ultimate principles.
