Before embarking on a study of the four types of authentic language, we should examine some of the defects of spurious language and the consequences of its use. Spurious language consists in words and sentences taken out of a stable context and used without verification of meanings.

Nearly all discourse concerning religious, philosophical, political, and historical questions is tainted with the defects of spurious language. Participants attempt to communicate without due verification of the meaning of the linguistic elements they use, and mostly without regard to any canons of grammar or language. The misunderstandings that constantly arise in human intercourse are due in the main to the disregard of meanings. No serious attempt is made to relate linguistic elements to any immediate experience, or to take account of the fact that **meanings can only be discerned when there is a recurrence of common experience within a recognized context**. 

Through disregard of the categories or of any even approximately equivalent discipline of thought and language, many fictitious signs and meaningless sentences are used without questioning their validity. Thus a sign which should name a recognized recurrent whole is used to refer to situations that exist only in the imagination. 

In ordinary language, words are seldom used correctly except in reference to material objects and their functional transformations observed through the senses. **For all inner experience concerning human consciousness and for the description of processes that are not directly given in sense-experience, words for the most part are signs for nonexistent or very dubious wholes.** 

For example, people continue to use such words as 'Christianity', 'Democracy', or 'Bolshevism' when there is no element of experience of which these words could be a sign. We have already remarked how the word 'meaning' itself has become a spurious word that has the effect of creating the illusion that something is being said, simply because we do not ask ourselves what 'meaning' means. 

Failure to make necessary qualitative distinctions is a further source of the debasement of language. Psychology is an example of a field of discourse in which authentic communication is well-nigh impossible because authors and speakers almost invariably disregard the distinction between the functional activity, the state of consciousness, and the act of will. The confusion is all the greater in that the sentences used purport to be making the very distinctions that they ignore.
