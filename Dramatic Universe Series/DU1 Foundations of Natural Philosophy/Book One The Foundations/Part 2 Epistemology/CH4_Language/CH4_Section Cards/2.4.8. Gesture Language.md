The communication of understanding is not achieved either by sign or by symbol. If being is apprehended by intuition, will can be understood only through participation. The language of will, going beyond the communication of meanings, reaches a common affirmation—an act of will in which the participants share. Before we can approach the study of will-language, we must remove a common misconception as to the possibility of communicating understanding. Both understanding and the communication of understanding are impossible without a shared stable context of knowledge, being, and will. Men can understand one another in ordinary life only where domestic or economic forces impose upon them a relationship of being and a community of action; yet by a strange, but not uncommon, aberration people assume without question that they can understand ultimate realities that are, in fact, utterly beyond their reach. Goodness, truth, justice, and other manifestations of conscious will, that no ordinary man can even begin to apprehend, are discussed in the mixed language of sign and symbol in which the words used have no recognized meaning. It must, moreover, be remarked that successful concerted action is no evidence of a common understanding. It is the technical reference and not the understanding of the participants that produces unity of action. For example, a game of cricket is a technical reference that brings into play acquired techniques and by its rules and customs ensures a sequence of concerted actions on the part of the players and spectators. This sequence includes not only the bodily activities but also the mental experiences of curiosity, expectation, the evocation of memories, and the emotional satisfactions of success and failure. We may observe in this context a recurrent element that we express by the sign-word 'team-spirit' and the meaning of the sign is held in common by all those who speak about the game, but the meaning of team-spirit is not the same as the meaning of 'common understanding'. The former is external; it is produced by the technical reference, and when the technical reference ceases—that is, when the game comes to an end—a new technical reference, such as an economic dispute between employers and employed, may substitute a quite different meaning for that which the word 'team-spirit' possessed during the game. 

Although understanding is wrongly attributed to many human situations, it can nevertheless be found in a germinal form wherever there is an authentic relationship of will. Since the relationship of will is doing, we shall employ the term gesture to denote the mode of expression by which the language of will is created. To grasp the significance of gesture, we should compare the three modes of expression: 

**Signs:** Each true sign has a single meaning, but the meaning is the recognition of a recurrent element that runs like a thread through the context of experience. Many experiences are needed in order to establish a single meaning. There is, however, a one-to-one correspondence between sign and meaning. 

**Symbols:** A symbol has as many meanings as there are gradations of being to which it refers. The symbol has not only meaning, but it is also a direct experience of being. The power of a symbol cannot be discovered by way of interpretation but only through intuition. Never the less, because one symbol can have many meanings and is applicable to many situations, it must necessarily fail in respect of concreteness. It does not fully relate the experience to its context. 

**Gestures:** Every gesture is unique. Bearing its own meaning, it requires neither interpretation nor intuition. Different gestures may be similar and similar gestures may be repeated, but the uniqueness of the gesture remains its dominant characteristic. The gesture is not taken out of the context, but made in the context. 

For better for worse, every gesture is an act that determines the future course of history. The scale of the act may vary greatly. Sometimes it will be very small and the consequences hard to discern. At others it may be so great that all human experience is changed by it. A gesture is eternal—that is, timeless—and yet it reverberates both in time and in space. It is never repeated and yet it recurs. 

The uniqueness of gestures corresponds to the uniqueness of understanding. The understanding of one situation cannot be transferred to another. Understanding is always new because it is always an act of will, and the language of understanding must itself be an act of understanding. In the language of gesture, no word, no act, ever means the same thing twice. It is the language of the whole man, and it can be used only by a man who is himself a fully structural whole. The 'gestures' of ordinary men are no more than the automatism of their functions. The meaning of such gestures does not belong to those who make them, but to the universal processes into which they are merged. We must therefore not be misled by the fact that a gesture is sometimes a sign or a symbol. 

A further point that here requires to be noted is that the ascription of gesture to the highest order of language must not be confused with the theory of language that regards its origin as rooted in pantomime.$^1$ The belief that words are gestural in origin may be valid, but wrongly interpreted in the theories that regard language as having developed from the automatic gestures of the brutes. 

We must also here refer back to the distinction made at the beginning of this chapter between language, art, and magic. Neither art nor magic are properly speaking language, although they employ both symbol and gesture. Even in the highest language the gesture stands for the understanding. It is not a mode of action. 

Nevertheless, at the highest level, language, art, and magic do merge. Experience, communication, and action are separate only when there is a divided will. With unity of will, language of gesture breaks through the divisions of function and being. Where understanding is perfected, gesture becomes a universal language. Whoever perceives the gesture of the perfected individual understands it according to his own capacity, but he is not left untouched. It is this action that brings gesture language into intimate relationship with art and magic. Communication by way of gesture has different levels of perfection. At the lowest it depends upon a common context established by common endeavour, but at the highest the context of the gesture is the whole of human experience. The individual who is capable of making such a gesture is himself a creative power. For the gesture does more than produce the context. It is itself the context of its own expression. 

We find ourselves of necessity in the realm of speculation when we endeavour to carry our analysis of language beyond the context of our own experience. We do, however, encounter in the history of mankind examples of gestures that continue to reverberate and that convince us us that this language is indeed the supreme act of communication.

$^1$ Cf. Sir Richard Paget, Human Speech, p. 174: "Human speech arose out of a generalized unconscious pantomimic gesture-language—made by the limbs and features as a whole (including the tongue and lips)-—which became specialized in gestures of the organs of articulation owing to the human hands (and eyes) becoming continuously occupied with the use of tools."
