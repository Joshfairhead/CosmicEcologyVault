The primary function of language is the communication of meanings. Ogden and Richards$^1$ have shown how many problems that should be faced are evaded, and how many unnecessary difficulties are also created by indiscriminate use of the word 'meaning' to refer to completely different elements of our experience. We should therefore define the word 'meaning' as carefully as possible, and endeavour to use it only within the limits of the definition. Since language refers to meanings, we cannot ascribe meanings to language itself. Moreover, the indirect character that we have attributed to linguistic communication consists precisely in the fact that words have no intrinsic meaning. A linguistic element has meaning only by reference to an experience that can be shared. Moreover, the experience must be recurrent and therefore capable of being recognized. The definition of meaning that we shall adopt can accordingly be formulated as:

A meaning is the recognition of a recurrent element in experience, and a linguistic element has meaning only in so far as it refers to a recurrent element of experience recognized by those who use it. 

The concept of meaning can be related to the categories in the form of a tentative series of rules or canons of linguistic usage set out in the following table. 

Meanings and the Categories:
**(i) Wholeness:** Every sign, symbol, or gesture used in language is in respect of meaning a recognizable whole. 
**(ii) Polarity:** Meanings arise by exclusion as well as inclusion; that is, they have context as well as content. 
**(iii) Relatedness:** Every meaning serves to connect an experience to a referent; the content is relative. 
**(iv) Subsistence:** An act of communication comprises four elements: the communicants P and Q, the object of reference O and the linguistic element S that 'stands for' O. 
**(v) Potentiality:** Every linguistic element has more potential meaning than can enter any actual communication. 
**(vi) Repetition:** A meaning is the recognition of a recurrent situation. It becomes articulate when associated with a linguistic element. 
**(vii) Structure:** Language has a sevenfold structure. 

This table requires some elucidation. The general rule, 'one linguistic element—one meaning', is only valid as applied to signs. Taking into account the relativity of wholeness, we can see how the meaning of a given concept is relative to the fullness of experience from which it is derived. A meaning based on two or three recurrences of a given experience cannot be as full as that based on many hundred recurrences, each of which adds its own quota to the content of the meaning. 

The distinction between content and context turns upon recognition. A context is a recurrent set of related entities within which we recognize one or more elements. What we recognize in this way develops by repetition into the 'meaning' of the experience. The meaning has thus two polar components, one that affirms and the other that denies it. The negative component is the context against or out of which we take the positive meaning. The context is thus no less necessary for meaning than the content, and for the purpose of communication it provides the common ground. We shall use the term stable context to denote a set of experiences that are shared by different people and are recognized as recurrent. Within this context specific elements having a common meaning can be discussed, clarified, and delimited. By this process the act of communication acquires subsistence—people begin 'to understand one another'. The category of potentiality is very important for the understanding of communication. It is an immediately verifiable datum of experience that we never can say all that we mean, nor mean all that we say. 

The sixth and seventh categories help to fix the true status of language, and show that it corresponds to the level of organized existence; for the categories of recurrence and structure apply directly only to fully organized wholes, and where language does not conform to the canon of structure, communication must in some way break down.

Passing from general considerations, we can consider a few particular examples of meaning. The meaning of the word 'table' is the recognition of a group of sense-impressions, the general pattern of which is recurrence, and the experience of which is common to human observers— past, present, and future—accustomed to living in furnished houses. It will be noted that we do not say that meaning derives from recurrence or even from the recognition of recurrence; for according to our definition the meaning is the recognition and the recognition is the meaning. What we do not mean we cannot recognize, and what we do not recognize we cannot mean. Moreover, no experience isolated from the context of recurrences could have a meaning. The word 'table' itself is a conceptual sign; that is to say, its meaning is reached by way of interpretation. The process of interpretation may be different for different people, and therefore the meaning of 'table' can also vary. For an inhabitant of Persia or Turkestan it will mean a low object around which people sit or kneel on the floor; whereas for a European it will mean one at which they sit on chairs. Thus it can be seen that the potential meaning of the conceptual designation is, and must be, always fuller than it is for any actual moment of use. If now we take the sound written 'ugh' and treat this as a word, we can call it an expressive sign. Its meaning—though different in character from that of 'table'—is also a recognition; namely, that of an emotional state of displeasure or distaste, the experience of which recurs in certain contexts and can be shared. 

The transition from repetition to structure takes us from grammar into syntax, and brings us to a consideration of the meaning of sentences and of communication by means of linguistic forms as distinct from single signs. Whereas the adequacy of a sign can be tested by reference to the categories, a sentence has a content beyond adequacy; namely, that of truth or falsehood. The content of a true sentence is knowledge; but not all knowledge is expressible in sentences, nor do all sentences express knowledge. Moreover, in accordance with the principle of structure, a complete language should comprise seven distinct qualities, of which two only are the adequacy of reference and the expression of true knowledge. There are also in language the properties of feeling, tone, and intention that Richards adds to those of reference and truth. Apart from these, there are the qualities of form and rhythm, all of which play a part in the expression and communication of meanings. 

Finally, there is the character of the context; that is to say, the aspect of experience to which a particular form of language applies. In this sense we can distinguish the forms of language that correspond to the different functional activities of man—thought language, feeling language, and instinctive language. These are the subjective counterparts of the objective distinctions—language of function, language of being, and language of will.
