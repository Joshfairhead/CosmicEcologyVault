Discipline in associative thinking gives rise to logical thinking. It is necessary to make judgements of value and truth – sometimes to hold more than one idea at a time. This goes beyond polar thinking. Synthetic judgements can be made. This third option requires ‘dialectical thinking’.  This is a different order of thinking. However, it is still inadequate as it gravitates towards linguistic ambiguity. It is therefore necessary to explore higher modes of thought. This risks speculation.
