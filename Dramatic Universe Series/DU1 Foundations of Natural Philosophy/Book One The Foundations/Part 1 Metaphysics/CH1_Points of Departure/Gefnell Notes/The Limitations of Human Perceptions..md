We do not have the necessary instruments to find answers. We simplify when confronted with the complicated.

Man cannot hold more than three ideas at a time; his judgements are based on like and dislike; his reactions on pleasure and pain.

We experience the world in a linear manner, but there are many lines of time. Therefore, most reality is not present most of the time.

Because we cannot see into the future, we assume this is true for all existence.  We explain our relationship to higher powers in terms of our own capacities. This is naïve.

A Man lives for only a short while; he would need longer to reach his potential. This brevity is compensated for by collective memory. Man then depends on the written word. This limits him. In fact, any individual experience is very narrow.
