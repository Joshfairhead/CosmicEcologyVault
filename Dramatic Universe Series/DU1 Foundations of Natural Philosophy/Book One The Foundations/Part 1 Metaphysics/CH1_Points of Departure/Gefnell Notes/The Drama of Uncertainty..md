To admit to uncertainty seems like abandoning everything philosophers have sought: the Greeks and Chinese for example.

Man has gone through causality, universality, and determinism, but must conclude that none really work. He must embrace uncertainty and hazard. To do this means that there is no divine providence – which itself is uncertain and hazardous. There is no unfolding storyline. As such, man has a role to play in what happens.

We can therefore speak of a **Dramatic Universe**.  The Drama of Uncertainty.  But consciousness is necessary, so that it is not a question of ‘blind chance’.

We take account of uncertainty – of the world and our own sense experience.
