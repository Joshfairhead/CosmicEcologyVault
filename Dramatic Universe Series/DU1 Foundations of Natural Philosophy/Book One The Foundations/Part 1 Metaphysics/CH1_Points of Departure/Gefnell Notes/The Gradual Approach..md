Restricting evidence is one way of constructing the plausible. If we accept all experience, we get out of our depth.

Ever rational argument includes to irrational. Therefore, human reason is limited. Scientific method cannot take account of the unrepeatable and the exceptional – which is part of aesthetic experience.

There are laws that defy communication; laws of understanding not knowledge.

Quality is authentic in experience, but it cannot be known, like quantity.

To know all possible experience is beyond man; so we need to go slowly, looking for the simple and universal. We can build a world-picture, the details of which we can add later. This is ‘progressive approximation’. It starts with something vague and incomplete rather than precise and convincing. For example, we begin with the ‘total giveness’ of experience. We shall not look for simplicity, clarity, or to express our intuitions in satisfactory language. We must accept error. We are looking beyond thought processes, not limiting ourselves to self-perception and logical deduction. What we seek is mockery to the empiricist, a stumbling block for the rationalist. We can never accomplish it.  But the search matters – for the true manifestation of human nature.
