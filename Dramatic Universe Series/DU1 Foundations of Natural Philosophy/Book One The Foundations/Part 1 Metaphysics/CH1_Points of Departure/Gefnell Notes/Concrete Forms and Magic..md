Counting, pairing and recognition of quality does not exhaust the possibilities. Numbers have meaning in their own right: two and two-ness, three and three-ness. So, there is significance of number but it is difficult to classify.

We must find a new way to think number. Logic and number are inseparable.

The search for the ‘concrete significance’ of number is ancient. By concrete significance we mean ‘direct experience of’. This can be observed in Magic, whereby men seek to influence events.

Magic has always formed a part of human events. There are two attitudes to it: One is that of science, religion and philosophy (official) which reject magic as superstition; the Second is of uncritical acceptance. Magic is not just superstition though; for example, belief in technology.

We need a course between naïve acceptance and rejection.
