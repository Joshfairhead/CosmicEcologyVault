Number is significant since, if we cannot think beyond three term systems, we know that they exist: four, five, six, etc. Number is therefore a significant category of thought; they form yes/ no categories. So, everything is reduced to arithmetic.

We can think of number various ways: matching pairs, so that no object is left unmatched. Cardinal numbers do this.

Or, number by repetition: ordinal numbers.

The two are quite different.

Another is ‘arithmetic quality’ – which concerns inner relationships of a group; for example, the properties as the distinction between prime and composite numbers.
