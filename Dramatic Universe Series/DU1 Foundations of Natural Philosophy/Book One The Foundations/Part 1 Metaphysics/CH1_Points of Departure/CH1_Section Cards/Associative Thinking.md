Most of us only experience passively the stream of associations and mental images that are presented to us by the automatic working of our nervous system. The phenomena of 'interest' and 'concentration' can be traced to chemical reactions in the blood that intensify the activity of the vegetative nervous system as it impinges upon the working of the thalamo-cortical mechanism. In such automatic processes, involving very large numbers of reactants, the resulting combinations depend effectively upon chance or accident, and, realising this, we might well be led to the conclusion that even the great discoveries of science are no more than the unusual combinations that have a finite probability of arising in such cases. There is, however, in the specifically human nervous system a mechanism of selection that increases the probability that thought and feeling by automatic association may give an interesting or useful result. Even when we have allowed for this selectivity, a close study of human achievements must convince us that, however rare it may be, authentic creative thinking and feeling do sometimes occur in man, and that nearly all that is interesting and significant in human life has been initiated by these infrequent phenomena.

If we inquire further and seek for the factor that enables the automatic associating mechanism in man to enjoy at times moments of authentic freedom, we soon discover that this factor is closely related to the mysterious property of self-consciousnessâ€”a property that distinguishes man from any machine that he is able to construct. When we come to examine the role of self-consciousness, we can see that the quality of thought depends upon the number of independent ideas that can be embraced with their full significance within the compass of a single conscious state. Nearly all human cogitation consists, as we have seen, in the automatic association resulting from the successive presentation of ideas that themselves consist of the material of past sense-impressions. To this process the laws of probability can be applied to explain why it is that only one mental act in many thousand millions gives rise to any new or significant combination of ideas. It must be apparent that, if we seek to open new pathways for the mind, we must explore the possibilities that arise through combinations that go beyond the usual associative forms of thought.
