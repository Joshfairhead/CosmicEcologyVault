If by 'thinking' we mean the conscious direction of mental processes towards a determined aim, we are bound to say that few people 'think' at all. The extreme rarity of consciously directed thought can be seen in sharp contrast with the general mechanicalness of all our human functions. Self-initiated, purposeful action carried through to an effectual conclusion plays almost no part in any phase of human life. The differences that we observe between one person and another consist, not in different degrees of conscious control, but in variations in the scope and effectiveness of the mechanism for automatic association and response. Even so-called 'intentional thinking' and 'directed attention' are, for the most part, only reactions whereby two regions in the central nervous system respond simultaneously to a given stimulus.
