Whitehead has reminded us that narrowness in the selection of evidence is the bane of philosophy. Any system can be made to appear plausible, so long as we reject and ignore those elements of experience that have no place in it. If, however, we set ourselves the task of treating all experience with the same respect—whether it be rational or irrational, scientific or unscientific, communicable or incommunicable—we find ourselves very quickly out of our depth. Since every rational argument must involve at least one non-rational premise, no one can question the limitations of human reason. The scientific method of observation and experiment cannot take account of the unrepeatable and the exceptional, which occupy so great a place in our aesthetic experience. Moreover, there are laws which defy communication because they are laws of understanding and not of knowledge, and which yet are no less certain and no less universal than those which can be expressed in the language of words and symbols.

Quality is an authentic element of all experience, but it cannot be known in the same manner as quantity is known. Our intuitions of quality are different from those of quantity and they cannot be expressed in the same language, and yet all experience, whatever its nature, is an awareness of qualities. No system of thought can ignore quality without incurring the risk of a sterility that is the more deadly for being often self-satisfied and blind to its own limitations.

Nevertheless, the task of confronting all possible experience is beyond the power of any man; and we should be foolish to embark on it unless we are prepared to go slowly, searching for the elements which are both simple and also universal, but not expecting to grasp their full significance. We can then hope gradually to build up a world-picture, at first in outline only, afterwards filling in details where we find it possible. This can be called the '[[method of progressive approximation]]', and it will be discussed in detail in a later chapter. Its chief characteristic is that it starts with a total concept that is necessarily vague and faulty; rather than with a concept that, though perhaps precise and convincing, is necessarily abstract and incomplete. We shall begin with the total givenness of all experience and, without forgetting the limitations of our powers of perception and thought, try to see that totality as one. We shall not look therein for simplicity or clarity. We shall not expect that we shall be able to express our intuitions in satisfactory language or to communicate them otherwise than most inadequately. We have, moreover, to accept the inevitability of error. The immediacy of sense-perception and the reliability of logical deduction have little part in the attempt to penetrate to the form of experience, which is in the true sense metaphysical—that is, beyond the senses and not subject to the limitations of thought. The concrete form for which we search is a mockery to the empiricist—but it is also a stumbling-block to the rationalist. Moreover, we embark upon our task with the presupposition that it can never be finally accomplished. Nevertheless, it is the search that matters, for it is the manifestation of the true human nature, the meaning and the place of which we are striving to understand.
