To admit that all existence is uncertain and therefore hazardous may appear as the renunciation of all that mankind has striven for during the last two thousand five hundred years. It is held to the credit of the Greek philosophers that, in leading mankind into the age of reason, they banished for ever those mysterious fears in which primitive man was supposed to have lived. The Greek philosophers—from Thales to Aristotle—were all in quest of a final solution to the great human problem of the meaning of existence. Even Anaximander, with his principles of 'strife' and 'the fathomless', believed that he had put aside the mysterious and the arbitrary in favour of a law of universal and ultimate validity which could be known and allowed for in the ordering of human affairs. Those who, like Heraclitus, believed that the meaning of existence was to be found in the saying 'all things pass away and nothing abides' also took it for granted that beyond the perpetual flux there was something stable—the One and the Many; 'out of all, one; out of one, all'.$^1$ In India, Gautama Buddha—contemporary of the early Greek philosophers—expounded his doctrine of universal causality, assuring his followers that the mystical fears by which they had been oppressed were illusory, and proclaiming that man could and must rely upon himself to work out his own salvation. In China, Confucius taught the reliability of human reason and adjured men to banish their fears of the unknown.

Since then a hundred generations have lived and died, and the banishment of mystical dread has been so successfully accomplished that modern man no longer fears the invisible. Instead, he finds himself confronted with the visible terrors of his own handiwork, and sees himself involved again in the uncertainty of history from which, until quite recently, he believed that he had been, or was soon to be, delivered. Belief in universal law has recoiled upon man, and in place of uncertainty he has found himself driven to the conclusion that inexorable causality shapes the future even to its minutest detail. Since this conclusion is fundamentally unacceptable to our human nature, we face a dilemma from which we cannot escape so long as we cling to any belief in absolute laws or final answers. This being so, we are forced to admit that rationalism can give no more than a false security that does not work in practice, and that it is necessary to look more deeply into the situation and to recognize that uncertainty and hazard must always be taken into account.

When this decisive step is made, we discover that we leave behind a great part of the difficulties with which human thought has been beset in the attempt to reconcile our human experience with belief in universal order and Divine Providence. If all that exists is uncertain, then it is not surprising that our human life is uncertain also. If uncertainty holds sway even in the operation of the Divine Will, then we can reconcile ourselves to the spectacle of human sufferings, against which we must revolt so long as we have to believe that they are a negative oasis set in a desert of perfection. Furthermore, the recognition of uncertainty and hazard in the working of universal laws restores significance to our own human strivings. If man is not a pawn in the hands of an omnipotent and omniscient chess-player, then he may be something much more significant; to wit, a being upon whom rests real responsibility for taking his own part in the universal task.

Conscious experience faced with hazard is a state of need, and need confronted with uncertainty as to its fulfilment is dramatic. Therefore we may speak of a dramatic universe, thereby drawing attention to the character which all existence acquires through the presence everywhere of relativity and uncertainty, combined with consciousness and with the possibility of freedom. Where there is no drama—no suspense—there is no deep significance. It is artificial and inconsistent to suppose that there can be a drama of uncertainty and suspense in the life of man but none in the great universe.$^2$ In order to appreciate the full significance of the force latent in the idea of a dramatic universe, consciousness must be restored to the efficient status from which it was banished by the atomists and by their modern descendants the logical positivists; for, confronted by efficient consciousness, uncertainty is no longer blind chance.

We may see here the dawning of a new light upon cosmological problems which will disclose to us a supreme uncertainty in the ordering of the universe—an uncertainty that must reach its greatest intensities in the Divine Nature at the one pole and in the atomic nature at the other. We have to change in a thorough-going manner our attitude towards our human capacity for apprehending reality; for we must take into account not only the universal uncertainty, but also our own inadequate perceptions and our inability to understand even the little that enters our experience through the organs of sense.
