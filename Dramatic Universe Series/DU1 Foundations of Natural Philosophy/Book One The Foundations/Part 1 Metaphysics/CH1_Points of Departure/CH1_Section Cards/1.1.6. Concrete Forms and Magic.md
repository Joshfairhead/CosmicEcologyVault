Even with counting, pairing, and the recognition of quality, the full significance of number is far from being exhausted. Numbers have meaning in their own right. The number two is not merely the symbol of duality; 'twoness' depends upon and defines the separation of opposites. The number three is indissolubly connected with the very idea of relatedness. Three as a class concept is an abstraction from experience— three as a relationship is an integral part of experience itself. This leads us to seek for a property which can be called the concrete significance of number. Although we may be convinced that such a property really exists, we are also forced to admit that it eludes our attempts at classification. We are not, however, on this account entitled to dismiss concrete number as illusory, and still less to regard it as unimportant. If we are ever to free ourselves from the limitations of logical thinking, we shall have to discover a new significance in number; for number and logic, as we know them today, are inseparable.

It is said that the Greeks were inclined to over-emphasize the static aspect of number.$^1$ Certainly Plato seems to have looked upon numbers as having little more than arithmetical significance.$^2$  It is, however, noteworthy that Pythagoras regarded the tetrad as more fundamental than the triad. Anaxagoras, with his 'four substances', has the same basic outlook. Nevertheless, Pythagoras and the early Greek philosophers were aware of the Egyptian tradition, for which numbers were the key to understanding reality. Aristotle argued in much the same way as the present thesis regarding the significance of the numbers one, two, and three.$^3$

The search for the concrete significance of number is very ancient. It was already very old in pre-dynastic Egypt—more than five thousand years ago. At some unknown period earlier than the first written records, man had already become convinced of this concrete significance, and must, therefore, have seen how a number can enter directly into events as experienced by himself. If we interpret 'concreteness' as the property whereby a given form enters our direct experience, we can recognise the close connection—persisting from the earliest times—-between number and magic. Magic is the art whereby man seeks to influence events. It is therefore to be expected that belief in the concreteness of number should go hand in hand with belief in magic, and that with the repudiation of the one should come also the neglect of the other.

The study of human origins demonstrates that magic has always played a part in the formation of human character and human institutions. We cannot therefore disregard magic in our search for an understanding of human destiny. There are two current attitudes towards magic. The one can be called the official attitude of science, philosophy, and religion. These disciplines reject magic as primitive superstition, interesting only in the historical and anthropological sense as showing how great a progress man has made since the tentative beginnings of his search for truth. The second attitude is that of an uncritical acceptance of magic, either under its own name or under other labels which dissimulate in various ways the belief that supernatural forces act directly in the life of man. Acceptance of magic, however, goes far beyond naive superstitions. We still believe in magic, although we call it by different names. The faith that technology or some form of social revolution could liberate man from the need to work and to suffer is in its essence indistinguishable from the crudest beliefs in the efficacy of magic. It very often happens—perhaps nearly always—that the rejection of magic pictured in one form and blind faith in magic pictured in another are to be found side by side in the same person or in the same civilisation.

If, then, we are to make a right assessment of the task before us, we must recognise the need to steer a course between naive acceptance and equally naive rejection of the reality of concrete forms. This middle course consists in admitting that concrete forms must certainly exist, but that man such as he is has not the means to penetrate deeply into their essence.
