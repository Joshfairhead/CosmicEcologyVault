Subsistence is the limitation of existence within a framework that requires for its definition not less than four independent terms.

We pass from relationships to subsistence by the recognition that existence is always presented to us 'thus and so'. This requires a four-term system. The tetrad is, in an obvious sense, a combination of relations and the objects related, and, hence, stands for a situation that is more concrete than the triad alone.$^1$ To specify an event, we require four independent terms. Usually these are taken as three parameters of space and one of time, but we must not make the mistake of supposing that a tetrad is composed of two different kinds of terms. Subsistence means for us persistence in time and extension in space, but these two are not in practice inseparable. What we actually observe is change, which can be represented as a system of bodies in relative motion. The main point to be noted is that subsistence refers to particular situations. Every tetrad is unique, but the price it pays for this uniqueness is that it cannot become other than itself. Thus the principle of subsistence is essentially static. It is further to be noted that the fourfold framework need not be that of sense-experience in space and time. We could conceive of a pattern as subsisting within a timeless framework of space combined with the property of renewal. It is even probable that there are modes of being that subsist in an invisible world of space and potentiality. Hence it is necessary to formulate the principle without explicit reference to space and time.

Subsistence completes the first cycle of categories that can be called the 'categories of bare existence'. With the second cycle we both continue and repeat the progression to reach a fuller and more concrete experience of subsistence and individuality.
