Our categories are to take the place of the Kantian categories, some of which—for example, wholeness and subsistence—are given the same names and are defined by him as concepts by which alone anything in the manifold of intuition can be understood,$^1$ The Kantian categories do not go far enough, because they remain within a logical or dualistic framework. Aristotle, with his predicaments and post-predicaments, realized that there is a finer intuition that comes with deepening experience, but both Aristotle and Kant disregard the significance of objective number.

The integers attached to each category are not merely symbols, but designate the minimum number of terms which must be present in a given system in order that the corresponding category may be fully exemplified. For example, we cannot exhibit the nature of relationships by means of two terms alone; for, as Plato recognised, we cannot hold in our thought two independent ideas without a third to reconcile them.$^2$ Likewise, potentiality requires five terms because it is necessary to distinguish between what is and what might be, as well as to account for all the relationships into which a given system can enter.

It must be noted that the principles cut across the distinction of physics and metaphysics attributed by the accident of name to Aristotle, who saw more clearly than his disciples that the real problem of the philosopher is not to look beyond experience but to understand it. It is in this same sense that 'every man is a philosopher'; for our ability to find answers, not only to our deepest but also to our immediate practical problems, depends upon the grasp—conscious or intuitive—that we have of the principles and their operation. It is in this sense that Gurdjieff asserts that one of the fundamental strivings for man must be 'to know ever more and more concerning the laws of world creation and world maintenance'.$^3$ Whether we realize it or not, our ability to order and direct our lives depends upon the extent to which we grasp the operation of the principles, and especially those that have an active character; namely, those which correspond to the odd numbers. It can be said that the principles of wholeness, relatedness, potentiality, and structure are dynamic—that is, self-transcendent—whereas the even-numbered principles of polarity, subsistence, and repetition are static or closed—that is, self-sufficing

It will be convenient to set out the first twelve members of the series of categories as follows: 

| Dynamic Categories (odd) | Static Categories (even) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1 Wholeness              | 2 Polarity               |
| 3 Relatedness            | 4 Subsistence            |
| 5 Pontentiality          | 6 Repetition             |
| 7 Structure              | 8 Individuality          |
| 9 Pattern                | 10 Creativity            |
| 11 Domination            | 12 Autocracy             |

Here it must be emphasised that number twelve is not a terminus ad quem but a convenient resting-place. The principles continue with the categories, and the series has no assignable termination. For example, the tenth principle of creativity is important for any study of the universe, but for lack of understanding of the true distinction between the numbers from eight to twelve, we shall not attempt to express it in a verbal formula.

Before proceeding to consider the categories separately, we must note again that they are not derived in sequence merely by the addition of a fresh term. Polarity arises not solely by the juxtaposition of two wholes but by the formation of a dipole. Relationship is not merely the reconciliation of opposites, but the totality of a system in which three independent factors are joined to make one. Subsistence is neither a pair of dipoles nor wholeness plus relationship, although it includes both of these. It also imports into the four-term system the property of uniqueness that Hegel calls 'being thus-and-so'. Potentiality can be expressed as two triads forming a dipole, but it has its own peculiar quality that none of the earlier categories can convey. Repetition again carries us a step further towards the concreteness of experience in which to 'cognize' is to 'recognize'. Structure is not only repetition plus wholeness (6 + 1), potentiality plus polarity (5 + 2), or subsistence plus relatedness (4 + 3), but all these, together with the unique property of independence; that is, of having the ability to reproduce in a part the character of the whole.$^4$ The categories serve only as means for recognising certain properties of our experience and for studying them both separately and in their mutual relevance. Moreover, the principles have no end-point that we can represent to ourselves in thought, but they return again and again with increased significance as our own experience of life grows towards understanding.$^5$

- $^4$ The apparent similarity of the series of categories to Hegel's 'progression of the notion' must not mislead us into supposing that we have returned to the 'science of the experience of consciousness', of which Hegel claims that "finally when it grasps its own essence it will indicate the nature of Absolute Knowledge itself". Cf. G. W. F. Hegel, Phenomenology of Mind, trans. J. B. Baillie, Vol. I, p. 89. 
+ $^5$ Hegel's progression is absolute but finite, whereas the series of principles given here is relative but infinite.
