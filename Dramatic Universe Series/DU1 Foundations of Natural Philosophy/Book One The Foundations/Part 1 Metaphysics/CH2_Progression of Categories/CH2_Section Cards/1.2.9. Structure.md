A structure is a self-regulating system capable of relatively independent existence. For this seven terms are required. The word 'structure' is used in this context in the most general sense. There is a series of words for organized wholeness such as 'atom', 'molecule', 'cell', 'living being', 'organism', 'self, 'world', 'system', 'cosmos', that differ in meaning chiefly in the aspect of structure they serve to emphasise. The word 'atom', though commonly used for a very small particle, really means 'the smallest whole within which a given type of structure is fully exemplified'. 'Cell', 'living being', and 'organism' refer to the autonomous wholes that have the property of self-maintenance. 'World' and 'system' imply concreteness and self-sufficiency. Structure must be applicable equally to the shapes and proportions of structures in space, to the combination of rhythms and cycles in time, and, in the widest sense, to everything that participates in the universal process as a more or less independent system. It is by no means obvious that the principle of structure can be exemplified only in a system with at least seven independent terms, and it is necessary here to appeal to our concrete experience.

It is by no means obvious that the principle of structure can be exemplified only in a system with at least seven independent terms, and it is necessary here to appeal to our concrete experience.

Nevertheless, many examples of the seven-foldness of independent structures could be cited. Astronomers require seven independent quantities—the semi-major axis, the eccentricity and inclination, the longitude of the ascending node and perihelion, the epoch and the period—completely to define the orbit and position of a planet. Engineers need seven independent thrusts rigidly to fix a massive body. Such observations lend colour to the ancient belief in the special significance of the number seven.$^1$ But it is not enough that seven-foldness is frequently observed, for the principle requires that it should be associated pre-eminently with self-regulating structures.

Self-regulation is a property that could not have been foreseen from an examination of the first six principles taken alone. It requires them, but it transcends and transforms them. Some idea of the manner of the transformation can be expressed in the following table, which sets down the component categories side by side with the corresponding elements in the principle of structure.

|     | Category     | Element      |
| --- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1.  | Wholeness    | Identity     |
| 2.  | Polarity     | Direction    |
| 3.  | Relatedness  | Interaction  |
| 4.  | Subsistence  | Maintenance  |
| 5.  | Potentiality | Significance |
| 6.  | Repetition   | Renewal      |
| 7.  | Structure    | Endurance    |
A thorough investigation would go beyond what is necessary or possible at the present stage, and a simple example, taken from our observation of the growth of an acorn to an oak tree, must suffice. If we examine this process in detail, we can see that it would not be complete or significant without seven independent steps, as follows: (i) Fertilisation. (ii) Inner differentiation. (iii) Germination. (iv) The seedling. (v) The sapling. (vi) The tree. (vii) The end of life. 

The process starts from the moment when the ovum of the oak flower is fertilized. Before that instant there was no single whole in which all the possibilities of the future oak tree were present. At that moment of fertilization, the future oak tree, with the whole structure of its existence, is in a state of pure potentiality—within the limits of its hereditary determination everything oak-like is potential but nothing yet is actual.

Thereafter, actualization proceeds continuously but in distinct transitions, at each of which a frontier is passed and a new land of promise is entered. The flower dies—the acorn is formed—the acorn ripens and falls to the ground. Here is the moment of crisis, for, each year, millions of acorns mature but few germinate, since in order to do so the acorn must fall among favourable conditions such as pressure and a spot of of fertile ground with the requisite dampness. From germination comes the seedling. Once again there is a well-marked transition and, as nourishment begins to be drawn from the soil, the husk of the acorn is discarded. In the next stage—from seedling to sapling—the plant struggles for light and air. If it finds a place in the sun, the sapling becomes a tree of the forest and, unless destroyed by disease, by fire, or by the woodman's axe, it grows until it reaches maturity. It then begins to decay, and when its strength is finally exhausted, its life-cycle is completed and it dies. This is the structure of its life. This structure is something more than the wholeness of the oak tree; it goes beyond the relationships and transactions with its environment; it is a cycle, a rhythm composed of the minor rhythms of day and night, of winter and summer, of growth and decay.

By such an illustration, we can give expression to the universal principle of structure. What is true for the oak tree is true for our own lives; it is true for every completed cycle of human endeavour, and it is true for the snow-crystal and also for the galaxy.

Every completed structure conforms to the one universal pattern. In the first moment, everything is potential and nothing is actual; at the last moment, everything has become actual and all the potentialities are exhausted. From the standpoint of the forest, the various life-cycles of the trees are recurrent processes by which its existence is maintained. The life of the forest itself is a recurrent structure, with its interwoven rhythms, its daily and seasonal periods, and its self-renewal in the life and death of the individual trees.

A similar analysis applied to any completed structure would reveal the same sequence of seven steps. The difference between the principle of structure and the preceding principles is unmistakable. There is only independence when there can be exchange with the environment by which self-maintenance is self-regulated.
