We should at this point pause to settle the meaning of certain expressions that we have used and shall need to use further. The first to require clarification is the distinction between 'concrete' and 'abstract'. A concrete statement is the direct expression of the full content of a given experience; an abstract form is one from which some elements of experience have been omitted, thereby enabling attention to be directed to some particular aspect of the situation to the exclusion of others.

Abstraction is generally unavoidable, for it compensates for the limitations of our human powers of perception and thought. We have further to distinguish in our experience different stages, beginning with un-differentiated sensation and passing through perception and image-formation to the higher modes of cognition—the final goal being the attainment of Objective Reason. These stages have some of the characteristics of a spiral path up a mountain that returns to the same panorama hut upon a different level and so with a different perspective. Primary sensation is concrete and higher cognition is also concrete, but the ascent from the one to the other can scarcely be made without some sacrifice of immediacy, that is, without some degree of abstraction.

The first step from sensation to perception is made by an ordering process that depends upon the presence in our experience of certain primary data. We shall define as the categories those elements of experience that on the one hand are given immediately, and on the other appear to have a general or universal character. Used in this way, the word 'category' approximates to the Aristotelian 'different kinds of notions corresponding to the different forms'.$^1$ The categories are the means whereby we begin to construct from our immediate experience an orderly picture of our world. They are thus at once the completion of perception and the start of reasoning. When we begin to reason, we fix our attention upon the categories and seek to express the meanings they bear for us by means of words or symbols. The formulae so constructed can be called the principles. The categories, being the elements of our immediate experience and therefore certain, are concrete; whereas the principles, being the expression of our comprehension of these elements, are abstract and therefore subject to our own uncertainties and limitations. The categories emerge from our experience by a process of discovery. Even when no categories are named nor any principles formulated, the elements of experience are nevertheless recognised. Moreover, their emergence from the stream of immediate presentations proceeds in a definite sequence. Hence it is that the categories themselves form an ordered series and can be defined by the minimum number of terms that a system must possess in order to exemplify them. The first category is that of wholeness, which requires only one single term; namely, an element of experience that stands out in our awareness as present and persisting. If we go further and say that this element is itself and not other, we have already made the step to a two-term system and the category of polarity.

Polarity thus emerges as an inevitable consequence of the recognition of wholeness as an element of experience that is not its totality. The antithesis of 'this and not that' leaves us with two bare, or unrelated, terms. We discover, however, that the elements of our experience are always related; hence we find emerging the third category of relatedness, which requires at least three terms for its exemplification. Relatedness, in turn, is incomplete unless we bring it back to immediate experience with the characteristics of 'thus and so'. Since we find ourselves always obliged to take our experience as 'thus and so', we have to admit the fourth category of subsistence. Once again it is necessary to go beyond 'thus and so' in order to take into account all that might be, but is not, present. This additional element of our experience is the category of potentiality that requires five independent terms for its exemplification. These are followed by the categories of repetition (requiring six terms) and structure (requiring seven terms). This series must be continued until as many terms are included as are required to give the measure of concreteness that we are capable of grasping. Naive realism is satisfied with a one-term scheme in which there are no distinctions of subsistence. Naive dualism cannot go beyond polarity. Thus, at each step in the progression of the categories we find a greater 'sophistication'. The series has no end, except in the limitation of our own understanding. Examining the categories, we find that each has a field of significance conterminous with all experience. Nevertheless, the categories themselves can never exhaust experience for, whatever number we may reach, some degree of abstraction remains and an additional element must be admitted in order to move towards a greater concreteness. We have there-fore to study the categories as an endless progression, at each step of which there is a corresponding principle through which we state what we are able to understand of the category. Thus the growth of understanding requires, on the one hand, the discovery of the categories and, on the other, a deepening of our appreciation of their significance.

We have to be on our guard against supposing that the principles tell US anything that we have not already found in our experience. There is a serious misuse of language that consists in giving expression to our desires, beliefs, or fantasies and calling them 'scientific principles'.$^2$ The principle is no more than a device for retaining in our memory those elements of experience that we discover to be both immediate and universal, but, because of their presumed universality, principles are more than statements of fact. They correspond to a definite stage in the transition from sensation to reason.

- $^1$ The ten original predicaments—substance, quantity, quality, relationship, place, time , configuration, possession, activity, and passivity—do not form a progression nor, as Kant pointed out, are they much more than inspired guesses. Nevertheless, Kant himself was rightly criticized by Hegel for failing to recognize that there must be some principle of interpretation applicable to the categories themselves.

In cosmology we are again, like the philosophers of the Middle Ages, facing a world almost entirely unknown."
