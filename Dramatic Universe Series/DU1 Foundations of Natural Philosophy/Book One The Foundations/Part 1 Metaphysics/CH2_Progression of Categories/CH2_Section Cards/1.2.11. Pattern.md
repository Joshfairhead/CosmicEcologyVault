The word 'pattern' can be taken in a passive signification as the observed result of an orderly process. Thus we speak of the 'pattern' of a carpet. It can also be understood in a more active sense as that which serves to direct and order the process itself. In this way we speak of a carpet made 'from' a pattern. The order we recognize in the carpet is the pattern and it is also derived from the pattern. The German word 'gesetzmassigkeit', barely translatable into English as 'law-conformableness', conveys some of the twofold transitive and intransitive character of 'patternedness'. The universal significance of pattern is connected with the possibility everywhere and in everything of the affirmation of order in the midst of chaos. We do not, therefore, penetrate to the full significance of pattern as an element of all experience until we recognize that experience would lose all coherence if there were not always and in everything active sources of order. It is in this sense that pattern constitutes the ninth category of experience. It cannot be discovered except by passing through experience of individuality, and this determines its place in the progression of the categories. 

The principle of pattern can be now stated: 
All experience is pervaded by the influence of active sources of the order residing in the patterns of organized structures. Pattern requires not less than nine independent terms.
