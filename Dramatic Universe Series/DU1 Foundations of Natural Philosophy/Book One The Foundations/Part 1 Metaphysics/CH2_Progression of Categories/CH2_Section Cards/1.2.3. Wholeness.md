Wholeness is omnipresent but relative. Observing our experience and the behaviour of both living organisms and inanimate objects, we can discern a pattern of energy-exchanges to which we can apply the general term 'response'. There are different gradations of response that we express by words such as 'reaction'— 'sensation' — 'perception' — 'discrimination' — 'understanding'. The terms of this series are not well-defined, nor can we determine without further inquiry whether one form of response is independent of another.

Nevertheless, we can recognise a 'scale of response' that ranges over all that we know. If we now introduce the word wholeness, we are bound to admit that its meaning is relative to the gradation of response of which the object in question is capable. Inanimate objects can scarcely be said to recognise other wholes. A crystal, for example, can take up material from a solution for its own growth, but it does not respond specifically to the presence of another crystal, like or unlike itself. We can recognise selective responses in mechanisms, such as slot-machines, that we ourselves construct, but their ability to react selectively to specific wholes, such as pennies, derives from human experience. Plants appear to have some little power to recognise and respond to other objects as wholes.$^1$ Animals—even the most primitive—show a higher gradation of response. The response to wholeness is unmistakable in animals endowed with a nervous system; but it is sensed rather than perceived. The discrimination of wholeness in man proves on examination to be less than we might suppose. Our speech implies that the names we use are wholes, but we seldom verify the meanings we intend to convey. There is, however, convincing evidence that man in a heightened state of consciousness acquires a direct perception of wholeness that goes far beyond name and form, and penetrates in some manner into the very essence of the thing perceived.

Such considerations lead us towards the conception of wholeness as a property that is encountered in all experience, and as one that admits of degrees and is therefore relative. Since our habitual language takes no account of the relativity of wholeness, a reconstruction becomes necessary. Let us, for example, consider a group of words that illustrate various aspects of wholeness, such as 'unity', 'coherence', 'togetherness', 'completeness', 'order', 'organisation', 'organism', 'self-hood', 'individuality'. The meanings of these words show a certain gradation, in so far as we can recognise that we pass from a more abstract to a more concrete conception of the meaning of wholeness. There are, however, in such words as 'organism', implications of subsistence and structure that go beyond bare wholeness. If, then, we ask ourselves what are the gradations of wholeness, we see that they are determined by the extent or degree to which a given object is itself and does not merge into something that is not itself.

We have to make here an important generalisation; namely, that there is always meaning in the question: 'To what degree is this object itself?' We notice that all objects are not unified to the same degree—some are more coherent than others. Thus, a living organism has a greater degree of wholeness than a collection of dismembered limbs and organs on a dissecting table. In order to designate the property of an object that constitutes its gradation of wholeness, we may use the term 'togetherness' and, since it is desirable to emphasise that wholeness is inherent in the object itself and not in the way it is perceived, we may ascribe to every whole a precise index; namely, 'the degree to which a given whole exists independently and is distinguishable from its immediate environment'. The principle of wholeness asserts that the property of being oneself is universal and omnipresent and yet relative.$^2$
