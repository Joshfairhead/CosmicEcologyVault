It is necessary here to consider the scope and purpose of the analysis undertaken in this chapter. We started with experience as the given and have examined its content. In doing so, we have gone far beyond the limitations of the human mind, and have extended the concept of 'experience' to make it almost as comprehensive as such words as 'universe', or even 'Reality'. It would, however, be illegitimate to assume, without further consideration, that in an ultimate sense esse est percipi—to be is to be experienced—and that there can be no reality beyond experience. We must content ourselves with noting that we are for ever debarred from experiencing what is by definition inexperiential, and must proceed with our task of examining the data available to us. 

Experience itself is not homogeneous: it has elements differing in their essential nature—namely, the elements of function, of being, and of will. All three elements must enter into any possible experience and, since they can be described and defined without reference to any particular form or centre of experience, they can be called primary. 

An analogy, which we owe to Ouspensky, illustrates the relation between function, being, and will. He compares man to a room in which there are several objects, each having a given function. One might be a typewriter, one a sewing-machine, one a bed, the fourth a musical instrument, a fifth a microscope, a sixth a telescope, and so on. While the room is in darkness the bed can be used, but the machines can operate with at best very uncertain results and some cannot work at all. If one candle is lighted in the room, the machines will work better. The microscope and telescope are still useless, but something can be done with each of the others one at a time, if the candle is brought near to it. If now, in place of the candle, a bright lamp is lighted, all the machines can be used—even simultaneously—except the telescope, which has no purpose inside the room. The microscope can be turned to account, for enough light can be focused through it to resolve fine details. We may picture to ourselves that with its aid new results are obtained which none of the other machines can give; and that the working of the latter can be improved. Finally, we can suppose that the shutters are flung open, the light of day streams in, and the working of all the machines is now free and unrestricted. The telescope unfolds possibilities that were not even suspected so long as the work was confined within four walls. 

In the analogy, the machines correspond to function, the illumination to being. Since the machines cannot use themselves, we ask 'What uses them?' It is will that does so, more or less effectively according to the amount of light present; the use to which they are put depends upon function; the quality of their work depends upon being. The situation, as a whole, is the result of all three factors, and each of them pervades it through and through. Down to the smallest detail process— that is, function—is present; everywhere there is light—that is, being— though not necessarily the same degree of illumination; and everywhere there is an impelling factor—that is, will—whether it be a directive intention or only the automatic operation of external influences
