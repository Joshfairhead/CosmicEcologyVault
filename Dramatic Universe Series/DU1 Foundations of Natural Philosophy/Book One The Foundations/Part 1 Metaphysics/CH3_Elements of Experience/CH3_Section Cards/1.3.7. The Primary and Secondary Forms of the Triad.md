The results so far reached can be summarized by means of a table in which the primary form of the triad, function-being-will, is shown resolved into the three secondary forms of each component of this triad, corresponding to the cosmic, objective, and subjective aspects of every experience. 

The Fundamental Triad of Experience 

| Component aspects | Function  | Being         | Will          |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Cosmic:           | Function  | Being         | Will          |
| Objective:        | Behaviour | Materiality   | Law           |
| Subjective:       | Knowledge | Consciousness | Understanding |

It will be noted that the terms function, being, and will appear in both the primary and the secondary forms of the triad. It may be objected that an element of universal experience, being by hypothesis omni-present and hence independent of any particular form of existence, should not be treated as an aspect of the limited experience of a given whole. It seems, however, preferable to adopt this presentation rather than to introduce new terms, such as, for example, 'process' for 'function of a given whole', or 'existence' for 'the being of a given whole', since such a procedure would disguise the significance of the primary elements as factors which enter into every possible experience. Furthermore, we may observe that the three aspects of each primary component themselves constitute a triad. 

Knowledge is that which reconciles the behaviour of the individual to the universal function.<sup>1</sup> Consciousness is that which enables the material presence of an individual to exist in harmony with the universal being. Understanding is that which allows the individual, without losing his own identity, to play his part in the self-realization of the cosmic will. Thus, in each case the cosmic and objective aspects of wholeness find their reconciliation within the subjectivity of the whole itself. Finally, we can take each of the nine components of the secondary triads as independent factors out of which new triads are incessantly being formed, and so giving rise to all the diversity of universal and particular events. 

<sup>1</sup> This has been the view of many schools of philosophy, particularly that of Spinoza, whose conception of the relation between knowledge and function has much in common with that formulated here (cf. Ethics, Prop. 25-42). Spinoza regards 'essential knowledge' as nothing but the direct intuition of the eternal principles that govern the essence of things. Partial or incomplete knowledge is "the only cause of falsity. . . . Knowledge of the whole requires purification of the intellect" (Ethics, trans. Boyle, pp. 69, 241-63). For Spinoza, knowledge applies to the emotions and instincts as well as to the thinking functions, and in its highest form is the same as our 'understanding', and therefore not knowledge at all.
