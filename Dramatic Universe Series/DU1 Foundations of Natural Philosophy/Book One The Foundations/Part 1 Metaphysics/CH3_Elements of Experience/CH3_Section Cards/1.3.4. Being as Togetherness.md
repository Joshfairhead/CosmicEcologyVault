Being is a second element in all experience that is equally pervasive with function but entirely distinct. To appreciate the role of being we might compare experience to water that is through and through compounded of hydrogen and oxygen. Just as hydrogen cannot give water unless combined with oxygen, so also being cannot give experience unless united with function. As water can, under certain conditions, be partially dissociated into its constituent elements,<sup> 1 </sup> so also can experience be partially dissociated to give being that is not wholly blended with function. 

One great difficulty in exposing the theme of the present book consists in the fact that our ordinary language is applicable almost solely to distinctions of function, whereas we need to make communications about being and will also. For the unknowable element in all experience we have used the word 'being', but it is necessary to examine very carefully the meaning which this word has to bear. Being is given no less immediately in our experience than function, but it is given in a different way. Being concerns the status of our experience. For instance, the difference between the dreaming and the waking state is a distinction of being rather than one of function. Being imports the concreteness that makes experience non-illusory. The most significant character of being is that it is relative—the more the being, the fuller and more concrete the experience; the less the being, the less is the experience complete and exempt from illusion.

Being is not actualized. It is not a process, but to say that being is not a process does not mean that it has no connection with time. There is, for example, the fluctuation of inner-togetherness typified in the distinction between the sleeping and the waking states. Being does not become; but this does not mean that becoming is independent of being, for every whole is actualized according to the degree of its own inner-togetherness. A whole with very little inner-togetherness is actualized as part of the general process in which it is present. For example, the air in this room, consisting of molecules in random motion, stands near the lowest gradation of inner-togetherness. It has scarcely any history except as part of all that is going on in this house. Higher in the scale the artist, in the moment of an intense inspirational experience of a new vision of reality, has an inner-togetherness that is almost entirely independent of his environment. Such a moment is 'the point of intersection of the timeless with time'—a fusion of being and function. Similarly, to a scientist may come a supreme moment of unification in which ideas that were separate, and seemingly irreconcilable, become joined in a synthesis from which a new hypothesis is formulated. Whenever we examine such a moment, we find in it this character of an enhanced inner-togetherness, a breaking down of barriers, a unification of the separate. The facts remain unchanged but acquire a new reality.
