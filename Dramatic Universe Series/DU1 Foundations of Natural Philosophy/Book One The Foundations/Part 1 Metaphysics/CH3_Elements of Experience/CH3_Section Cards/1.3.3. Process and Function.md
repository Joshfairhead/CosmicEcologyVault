Wherever we turn our attention we find something going on; and, moreover, going on in a more or less orderly and recognizable manner, and these regularities—that is, the observable features—are the actual or potential subject-matter of our knowledge. What we know in this way can be called process. 

The conclusion we have now reached as to the arbitrary and misleading character of all attempted divisions of subject and object, or matter and spirit, can well be expressed by saying that process has no frontiers. Indeed, so universal and inescapable is process that we might be tempted to say that it is the content of all possible experience, and even to go so far as to identify it with 'Reality', or the totality of all that is.<sup>1</sup> The concept of process seems to hold its own even against criticism in terms of the categories, for whenever it presents itself to our experience we find in it wholes, polar opposites, relationships, and structures. 

Nevertheless, though we have defined process as the entire content of our knowledge, there are still elements in our experience that remain unaccounted for. We find that, so far as process is concerned, the content of a dream may be the same as that of a waking state. We may dream of looking out of a certain window and seeing the same tree as we should see when awake, and may even feel the same emotional reactions. It is evident that the all-important difference between the dream-event and the waking-event cannot be accounted for in terms of process alone —many other effects of deception and illusion must also be taken into account. The believer in spiritualistic phenomena, for instance, passes through an identical experience whether the voice he hears is produced by fraud or by some supernormal agency. Moreover, sense-perception itself plays tricks on us. If we did not know the techniques of cinematograph projection, we might accept the delivery of our senses that the movements of the figures on the screen is continuous and not a succession of intermittent images. There are yet other and subtler discriminations. For example, it may be that when walking through the fields in spring in a state of moody preoccupation, this state suddenly gives place to a joyful perception of the birds singing and the scent of the earth. We do not know anything new: the scents and sights are the same as they were a moment earlier, but our experience has acquired a new dimension. We may also consider process in terms of behaviour; we may ask the simple question: Is a man identical with his behaviour ? If it is not to ignore something essential in our experience, our answer will be: No, a thousand times no! Such an answer provokes the further query: Do we know the presumed man behind the visible mask; he who suffers and rejoices, hopes and fears ? We shall probably reply that we do not know him, but that he knows himself. 

Reasoning such as this is a dangerous path to follow, for it may lead into the pitfall of the dualism of two kinds of 'knowables'—one the behaviour known objectively, and the other the man who knows himself subjectively. This dualism would, if accepted, undermine the conclusion that there can be only one stuff, and would again involve us in all those contradictions and confusions that we seemed to have escaped. Fortunately experience itself can rescue us from this predicament; it tells us that the man does not know himself any more than we can know him. He cannot know himself, for what he is is not a process, and hence, by definition, is outside the scope of knowledge. All that we can know is what is going on, and in this respect it makes no difference whether the process that goes on is inside us or outside us. 

Our ingrained habit of accepting formulae without criticism has led us to take it for granted that the time-honoured phrase 'know thyself means what it seems to mean. It is, however, subject to the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, for it assumes that there is a Self that can be brought within the compass of knowledge. If the word 'Self means anything, it cannot refer to the processes that are given to us as the content of knowledge.<sup>2</sup> 

We can define the term function as 'the knowable element in experience'. This means that function has certain differentiations that are not implied in the word 'process'. Functions are the behaviour of wholes. Wholes are related to one another, and we know them because we can recognize structures or patterns of function. The step from experience of process to the knowledge of function is made by way of the categories. In order to think about our experience, we must make use of the categories. They enable us to make the step from our direct awareness of process to a knowledge of functional regularities. There is the universal process constantly actualizing itself. Through our self-awareness we experience this process from within, and through our sense-perceptions we experience it from without. All that we know in this manner is function. Function has always the same character wherever and whenever we find it. It may be the function of my mind in which thoughts are flowing, or it may be that of a clock which records the passage of time. Functions are, however, something more than mere activity. They are behaviour; that is, the working of some mechanism. A clock is a mechanism, and its function is to tell the time; the mind is a mechanism, and its function is to think. In our organism, the whole system of sensory and motor nerves—of spinal and cerebral ganglia—is a mechanism, and its function is to direct and co-ordinate our organs in response to stimuli received from the outer world. It will be noticed that in every reference to function it is taken for granted that it is concerned with what goes on in time and space. Function has this character of becoming actual, and therefore we are able to go beyond the limitations of our human experience and to give an extended definition of it as all reality actualizing itself through its several parts. 

Every description, of whatever kind it may be, is of necessity functional. A whole can be described completely, down to the smallest detail, in terms of function. For example, the life of man over a given period may be specified with any desired degree of accuracy by enumerating all that is going on in his thoughts, in his feelings, movements, sensations, organs, tissues, and so on. Although in these terms the account might be complete, it would not show how the various activities were united in his consciousness. At any given moment there will be present in him mental associations, fluctuations of feeling, instinctive processes, and bodily movements. He may be aware of one or more of these functional activities or, possibly, of none at all. They may have formed part of one and the same experience, or of two or more unrelated experiences, or have been outside 'his' experience altogether. Nevertheless, whatever may be their relation to the world of his private experience, all these activities are of the same kind. They are homogeneous in their nature, and their homogeneity overrides the frontiers of selfhood and the limitations of here and now. Hence we conclude that, being the know-able element in the universal process, function is everywhere and in everything. This does not, however, mean that function is the given totality; that is, experience itself. There are non-functional elements in experience, equally pervasive and equally significant, and we must now extend our inquiry to discover their nature.


<sup>1</sup> The title of Whitehead's Process and Reality may give the impression that process and reality are the same thing, whereas his 'eternal idea' stands outside process.

<sup>2</sup> The title of Whitehead's Process and Reality may give the impression that process and reality are the same thing, whereas his 'eternal idea' stands outside process.The writer of the First Alcibiades, in referring to the eye which must look outside itself in order to see, presents an argument that should lead to the conclusion that the Self cannot be known. Nevertheless, by confusing what is and what goes on, he has done much to fix in men's minds a faulty interpretation of this much-quoted phrase.
