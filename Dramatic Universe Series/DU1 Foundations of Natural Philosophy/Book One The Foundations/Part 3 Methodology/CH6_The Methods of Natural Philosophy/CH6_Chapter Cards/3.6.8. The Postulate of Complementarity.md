The connection between the odd and the even numbered principles shows that neither series can be understood without reference to the others.<sup>1</sup> We have seen an example of this in the need to bring into account both wholeness and polarity in order to formulate the postulate of the stratification of existence. Universal similarity can be recognized in the principle of structure, but other principles also must be taken into account. The ancient saying of Democritus, "The way up is the way down", can be restated as the postulate of complementarity, according to which it is, in everything, necessary to confront opposing views in order to arrive at meanings. We have already seen this in the relationship of fact and value. It appears in the realm of fact in the opposition of the dynamic and static aspects of experience formulated in the odd and even numbered categories. 

**There is a very difficult but at the same time necessary discipline that consists in regarding every situation as both an affirmation and a denial; every movement as both a rising and a falling; every process as both a concentration and an expansion. It is this last antithesis that requires our special attention here, and we can see it best by reference to the principle of structure.** Structures enter our experience in different ways, according to the perspective of space and time. A structure in space-such as a full-grown tree—is perceived as a whole, and its pattern consists in the arrangement and connection of the different parts: roots, trunk, branches, leaves, and so on. An event—such as the growth from the acorn to the oak—is experienced successively in time, and we have to penetrate beyond immediate sense-experience in order to recognize the event as a unity. There are also unified structures that are not experienced in time and space; as, for instance, a system of classification or organization. **The periodic table of the elements and the diatonic musical scale are examples of unified structures that do not depend upon any arrangement in space, nor upon successiveness in time.** **There are also structures that we experience, but can neither relate to space and time nor bring into any abstract logical scheme. The essential nature of man, with his inherent potentialities, is an eternal structure of this last kind.** 

Structure is indeed so fundamental that in our experience it is prior even to space and time. That this is so must be recognized if we are not to be misled by the great differences apparent in structures when they are seen from the perspective of temporal actualization. Events in time present various recognizable features. For example, there are conservative events, such as the persistence of a material object; there are cyclic events, such as the swinging of a pendulum; there are movements of expansion, such as the growth of an acorn to a tree, and there are the movements of concentration, such as the coiling of a spring. In each of these examples the same fundamental principle of structure is exemplified, but in different ways. The movements of expansion and concentration require special examination, because of their importance for any understanding of complementarity. **Concentration is a process whereby a higher gradation of energy is selected by a given whole, and lower gradations are rejected.** It is the essential pattern of life itself, but it also is present wherever there is the building up of potential energy in either organic or inorganic matter. 

If we return to the example of the acorn growing into a tree, we can see that the movement of expansion was preceded by a movement of concentration, whereby the genetic factors of the parent were stored up in the seed. In this process lies the difference between potential and actual. **That which has become actual and perceptible has to that extent exhausted its hidden potentialities.** Expansion is therefore a movement from the invisible towards the visible, whereas concentration is the return towards the hidden potentialities that are preserved uncorrupted in the eternal source. A simple example of this alternation from invisible potential to visible actual, and vice versa, is to be seen in the swing of a pendulum. Expressed in terms of observability, we can say that all the energy is observable at the moment when the velocity is at maximum— at the bottom of its swing—this is the state of visible energy. At the moment of rest at the top of its swing there is no visible motion, no momentum measurable by the force of impact against another body— the energy is invisible, latent but potent. 

Where the process is cyclic, the net outcome is that things remain as they are. Cyclicity alone, however, does not disclose the full significance of the interplay of concentration and expansion. We must therefore look for situations where the two movements can be separated. This separation can be seen in a building up of potential through such an act as heaving a boulder to the top of a hill. The potential built up or concentrated in the boulder can be preserved indefinitely until, for some cause extraneous to itself, it is dislodged and is set rolling to the bottom. In this case, the two processes of concentration and expansion are separated from one another in time. There is no cyclic renewal as with the pendulum, for all the energy of motion is wasted in friction and dissipated in vibrations of heat and sound. Heaving the stone up the hill is an event with its own structure in time. The same structure is reproduced in the opposite direction when the boulder rolls, but with the essential difference that the second process has only to be started and afterwards goes by momentum, whereas the first continues only so long as hard and unremitting work is put into it. This can be expressed by saying that the upward process is reversible but the downward is irreversible. 

At first sight it does not appear that every process of concentration conforms to the pattern of 'hard, unremitting work'. Nevertheless, when we look more closely, **we can see that concentration is always realized at the expense of the environment.** When the oak produces a seed, there is withdrawal of biochemical complexes of high potency from the sap and the surrounding tissues, and these in turn depend upon the extraction of nutrition from air, water, and earth.<sup>2</sup>

In the process of expansion, causal and statistical laws predominate, The system moves towards its most probable—that is, determined and therefore most stable—state. When in this static condition it has the lowest potential and therefore the least possibility of giving rise to any higher form of order. Concentration, on the other hand, is a movement towards an improbable state—one that is therefore of high potential— in which an unpredictable element enters the situation. Concentration is potent because its trend is against the stream of expansion—or probability—and so 'it can get somewhere'. 

According to the principle of complementarity there can be no unbalanced cosmic dyads—that is, pairs of opposites that have a universal character. Expansion and concentration are a typical pair that can be understood only if they are balanced in all processes. The peculiar feature of complementarity is that it is neither observable as a process nor unobservable as a potentiality. Such dyads as the particle and wave dualism of electrons and protons illustrate this peculiarity. Complementarity is the source of coherence by which the balance of existence is preserved. To express this property we shall adopt the term 'hyparxis', which is usually translated as 'subsistence' or 'existence', but which in its original meaning signified the ableness-to-be.<sup>3</sup>

<sup>2</sup> Many authors have discussed the relation between life and the second law of thermo-dynamics. Schrodinger, in What is Life?, described the living organism as "sucking negative entropy from its environment". Professor Luigi Fantappie, in Principi di una Teoria Unitaria del Mondo Fisico e Biologico (Rome, 1945), distinguishes between syntropic and entropic processes and seeks to show that they are to be found equally in the living and the non-living. He recognizes that the two processes do not always occur in succession—producing cycles analogous to that of the pendulum— but that each kind of process can come to and end without starting one of the other kind

Ross (Oxford 1924) p215 "??" 9-15, where it is clear that "diolog" meant for Aristotle the ableness of a given animal to approach the ideal existence of its species. The Neo-Platonists-Produs in particular-appear to have used the term with something of the significancte that we wish to ascribe to the intermediat e determining-condition.
