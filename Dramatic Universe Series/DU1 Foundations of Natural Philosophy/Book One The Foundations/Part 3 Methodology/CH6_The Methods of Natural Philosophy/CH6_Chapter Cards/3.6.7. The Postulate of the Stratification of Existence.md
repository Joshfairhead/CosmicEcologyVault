Selection in the course of reducing phenomena to facts would be a practically insoluble problem if we had no means of distinguishing classes of phenomena that can be assigned to the same gradation, or level, of existence.<sup>1</sup> The postulate of the stratification of existence provides such a means. By the principle that wholeness is a single-valued property, all existence can be divided into strata lying between the distinct levels of the intensity of inner-togetherness, and to each stratum may be assigned a numerical value according to a single scale—the universal scale of being.<sup>2</sup> This principle alone would not suffice to enable us to decide whether a given entity should be assigned to one or another given stratum, if there were not also a principle of separation deriving from the principle of polarity. 

Furthermore, the strata must be interrelated; for otherwise we should have to treat existence as constituted by a series of closed systems and therefore as incomprehensible. **The stratification of existence, however, has the peculiar quality of that although each stratum is closed to the others, yet it is only relatively so**. The closure of the strata can be called statistical inaccessibility—statistical in the sense that there is only a very small probability that an entity existing upon one level, while remaining what it is, will be transferred to exist upon another. **This situation can be expressed by a rider to the postulate; that each cosmic stratum, is statistically inaccessible to all other strata.<sup>3</sup>** 

The stratification of existence enables phenomena to be studied with reference to particular forms of order, without taking into account the general disorder or the presence of other forms of order. In this manner there arise the different branches of science, each of which has as its subject-matter a defined stratum of existence. Hitherto natural scientists have not directed very serious attention to the problems concerned with the relationship between different strata, but have confined their efforts to elucidating the factual laws operative on each level.<sup>4</sup> **The laws that govern the relationship between strata are not wholly factual but involve relationships of value.** Through the method of progressive approximation, however, it is possible to establish a general scale of existence in the first place, and thereafter to clarify the relationship between levels. Such clarification is mainly concerned with meanings, and it therefore goes beyond the strictly limited task of reducing phenomena to facts.



<sup>1</sup> The doctrine of levels of existence has been familiar to European thought since Aristotle constructed the first scale of being. The idea has been made explicit by MacTaggart in The Nature of Existence. He wrote: "If there are two varieties of thought of which one is higher and more comprehensive than the other, it will be impossible from the nature of the case for the lower and narrower to be directly aware that the higher is valid. From the very fact that the higher will have canons of thought not accepted by the lower, it must appear invalid to the latter, which can only be forced to accept it by external and indirect proof of its truth." Needham has applied the idea of levels to organization (cf. Time the Refreshing River). The important thing in all these conceptions is that the series of existents is recognized as having an order from a lesser to a greater degree of integration. 

<sup>2</sup> The concept of a scale of being can be traced back to the Chaldean cosmologists from whom it was brought to the west by Anaximander and Anaxagoras. Its history can be traced through Plato, Aristotle, Albertus Magnus, Lamarch and Geoffroy. Though now discredited, it was revived in a new form by Bergson, Alexander, and Lloyd Morgan. For an excellent account, see E. S. Russell, Form and Function (London, 1916). Cf. also Gurdjieff, All and Everything, p. 757.

<sup>3</sup> Cf. J. W. Gibbs, Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics. 'Statistical Inaccessibility' is a conception borrowed from Gibbs's treatment of the energy distribution in systems having a very large number of components. The canonical distribution C — Ao — E/O occurs when different levels interact, but only to a very small extent.

<sup>4</sup> Cf. J. Needham, loc. cit., Lecture XX, vi.'Levels of Organization': "What has not yet been done, however, is to elucidate the way in which each of the new great levels of organization has arisen. It must always be remembered that though we can chart out quite fully the laws existing at a given high organizational level, we can never hope to understand how they fit into the picture of nature as a whole; that is, how they join with the next higher and next lower levels." Quoting this passage, Kostler contends that Needham writes with "unconscious irony"; for that which has not been done was the primary aim of scientific explanation. Both miss the point; namely, that legitimate abstraction is the foundation of natural science, but that natural science is only an abstract discipline and that its apparent concreteness is fictitious.
