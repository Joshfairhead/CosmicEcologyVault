According to temperament, men are inclined either to hold to the old truths and suspect the new, or to make a cult of the new and despise the old. Through failing to find a middle way between these extremes, mankind is burdened with misunderstood discoveries that have degenerated into superstitions and has lost results of the greatest value achieved through the labours of the past. The dangerous belief that progress consists in replacing 'falsehood' by 'truth' is one of the chief obstacles to the advancement of true learning. The acceptance of a thorough-going relativity requires that we should always remember that we can know only partial truths, and that each fresh attempt to set up a system of universal validity is nearly always to build in the void, and the result, as the Russian proverb says, is only "To pour from empty into empty". There is a great mass of human experience extending over tens of thousands of years—including great discoveries made, misunderstood, and forgotten—and yet the latest discovery ever appears to be not only best but final. 

Man already knows nearly enough to answer the questions that really matter to him, but he cannot understand what he knows and therefore he cannot use it. It is very tempting to seek for explanations of this; for it is usually possible to construct a verbal formula or a mathematical expression that will fit a variety of observations which, when dignified by the name of 'theory' or 'a law of nature', gives the illusion that a 'truth' has been discovered. The value of such theories and laws is commonly assessed by the possibilities they give of predicting the results of experiments not yet made or of enabling quantitative assessment to be made of the likely outcome of a new process. Theories are said to have heuristic value when they point the way to successful observations or experiments. The wealth of such theories—abounding in all branches of science—would appear to be evidence of a very satisfactory position and, if successful experimentation were all, we could suppose that we were making steady headway towards understanding the true character of the universe, or at least of a great part of it. We must, however, make a distinction between the successful application of theories and the understanding of what they really mean. The former is the transition from science to technology, and the latter is the search for a valid cosmology.

Science and technology are the flower of the modern world. They have arisen through the discovery that, by attention to certain elements in experience and disregard of others, men can acquire knowledge that is effectual in increasing their adaptation to their world. This discovery has led to the method of specialization that has proved so powerful a factor in the progress of science. The spectacular achievements that can be placed to the credit of science tend to disguise the real sacrifices that such specialization entails; the actual outcome being that the more we know the less we understand. At times we are astonished and dismayed at the results of piling up knowledge, and yet we do not see what is happening; namely, that we are confusing passive adaptation with active 'doing', and mistaking slavery to our techniques for mastery of them. Because we have prized knowledge and ignored understanding, science and technology have hitherto proved sterile so far as concerns the attainment of objective aims for the welfare of mankind. 

Nevertheless, science does not lead to technology alone. It has brought to man new knowledge that can, and must, have decisive importance for cosmology; that is, for the aim of understanding himself and his place in the universe. This knowledge, however, can serve its purpose only when scientists are ready to recognize that their task is but half done when the bare facts have been established. The separation of fact from value is only a provisional expedient to simplify the first stage of the scientist's work. Heisenberg, Eddington, Schrodinger, de Broglie, and other great mathematicians and physicists of the present century have realized that pure science leads to a doctrine of values that is very close to that of revelation.<sup>1</sup> The self-imposed task of the scientist is to reduce the confused data of sense-experience to an orderly system. This he does by selecting from the data of experience groups of regularities that appear to have some significant features in common, and treating such groups as if they could be isolated from the rest of experience.<sup>2</sup> 

The method of isolation and reassembly of groups of data is convenient and even necessary, but it is not sufficient to ensure progress in the direction of greater understanding. This latter requires an evolution of meanings; that is to say, not merely the exchange of one set of signs for another but a deepening of the significance of the signs and symbols used. 

For the deepening of meanings, we need to return again and again to experience and thereby to enrich the content of our language. The method is that we have called progressive approximation; for its aim is rather to discover and express the meaning of what is already known than to seek for new discoveries. When this method is followed, the new and the old are given equal significance and the task of the investigator is to select, to eliminate, and to refine; so that the meaning of what remains should be clear and, being clear, can be understood. The process is neither analytic nor synthetic. It does not consist either in drawing conclusions from what is already known or in seeking for what is unknown, but in knowing what is known. Only this can lead to effectual knowledge in the sense defined in the last chapter. This method is in some respects opposed to our customary habits of thought, whereby we suppose that it must be possible from the start to say clearly and finally anything that can be said at all. We are accustomed to regard repetition as a defect of exposition and to suppose that an experiment once made need not be repeated unless some doubt is cast upon its accuracy. Progress in thought appears to us to be made by observation and inference; that is, by moving from the known towards the unknown. We do not recognize that we never give ourselves a chance to know anything as it should be known, because, with what we have attained only partially assimilated, we turn away restlessly in pursuit of new knowledge. The method of progressive approximation consists in returning again and again to examine the same material of experience in order to search for new depths of meaning and to transform these meanings into understanding.
