Unreflecting sense-experience, when reduced to order, gives rise only to very limited forms of knowledge. The possibility of a transition to knowledge which is universal, valid, and applicable depends upon the discovery—by reflection—of the categories. Our knowledge of the categories is fact, but it is fact of a very special kind—namely, fact harmonized with value and meaning. The achievement of this harmony is the goal of the work of progressive approximation. At an early stage in this work we acquire the conviction that fact is a system. This conviction enables us to formulate the basic postulate of the homogeneity of fact. We can thus establish a firm basis for our reasoning, and can regard fact as one realm, any part of which can be reached by means of an operation of a kind we already know how to perform. It is one of the principal tasks of natural philosophy to examine the implications of this postulate, and to apply it to the extension of our knowledge of fact beyond the limitations of our own immediate awareness. This task cannot be performed by attention to fact alone, for it needs constant appeal to meaning in order to select from the endless presentations of experience those phenomena that can best enrich our knowledge. 

The progress of science consists in finding improved means of passing from phenomena to facts. This progress is sometimes deceptive; for phenomena are pregnant with data—set moving by a good hypothesis— which must be marshalled and controlled. Thus the formulation of a scientific theory is comparable to opening a gate in a crowded sheep-fold. At first one or two bold ewes tentatively venture out; others follow, and in the end the exodus becomes a scramble, and both shepherd and sheep-dog are needed to control the flock. The temptation to multiply knowledge of fact is aggravated by the aim of achieving 'practical results'. We do not notice that knowledge of fact does not add to our understanding of phenomena, but merely serves to increase our adaptation to the functional mechanism of the world in which we live. **This adaptation we are pleased to call 'control of nature', not noticing that it can equally well be described as 'control by nature'. Knowledge brings us into gear, but it does not set us free.** 

The problems connected with the transition from phenomena to fact are the subject-matter of natural philosophy, the task of which is to ensure that we realize the significance of the passage from experience to knowledge. Even with the simplification gained by confining our attention to the experience of ordinary consciousness, the task of reducing the data of natural science to a single scheme grows more difficult year by year. There is a vast, incessant increase in the volume of data that constitutes our knowledge of fact. This is due in part to the systematic recording of sense-experience, and in part to the use of some apparatus that serves to extend observation far beyond the immediate delivery of the human organs of sense. Indeed, the quantity and variety of facts that have been discovered are so great that in the present century **scarcely any attempt has been made to build from them a single structure that could be called 'knowledge of the phenomenal world'.** In default of this, order is sought within various limited fields. This procedure works remarkably well in so far as we are content to specialize, but it tends to divert our attention from phenomena and to make us believe that fact is somehow directly given to us in our experience. Any suggestion that there could be a single structure in which all knowledge would find its place is distrusted by scientists who bear in mind the failure of the 'system builders' of the last two centuries, the discrediting of speculative philosophy, and the dominating position that analysis and criticism have recently acquired—all of which situations are mainly due to a limitation, introduced almost unnoticed, in the transition from phenomena to fact. This limitation consists in the assumption that cause and purpose are somehow discovered in our sense-experience. Facts are usually described in terms of a process in time, and these descriptions can scarcely avoid the use of the language of causality and purpose. Indeed, these notions are so deeply embedded in our ordinary language that it is hard to express ourselves, or even to think, without making use of them. 

In the twentieth century, natural science—by the sheer momentum of discovery—has weakened belief in much that was formerly regarded as solidly established truth. New discoveries have opened two lines of philosophical inquiry. One follows the old method of specialized hypothesis that enables phenomena to be described and dealt with as facts, and these in turn to be used for the purpose of technological advance; the other explores the hazardous no-man's-land that lies between phenomena and facts. The latter is dangerous ground for those theorists who believe that safety lies exclusively in the methods of observation and analysis. The experimental scientist, however, must needs remain in the danger-zone; for it is here that phenomena reveal themselves. Thus arises the recurrent misunderstanding between theoretical and experimental scientists; although in some branches of science it has already been found necessary to admit new facts of a kind that do not conform to the old rules of logic and cannot even be adequately expressed in words. 

In the past—in consequence of the uncritical adoption of certain loosely formed assumptions—scientists developed the habit of regarding the discovery of special regularities in a limited field as somehow more respectable and praiseworthy than the recognition of general principles —branding these as 'metaphysical'—and preferred to direct attention to what they called 'generalizations' from observation and experiment. Since generalization in any form means going beyond immediate experience, the legitimacy of such a procedure can only be taken for granted. More recently, however, scientists have come to recognize that an uncritical attitude towards general principles is not only bad philosophy but bad science. They have realized that many universal principles that formerly were accepted as having universal validity have subsequently proved incompatible with observed facts. For example, the natural philosophers of the nineteenth century in no way questioned the principle of continuity—natura enim in suis oper-ationibus non facit saltum—which appeared to be experimentally established for ever by the work of Joule and Kelvin. Perhaps the greatest shock to the complacency of physical scientists came with Planck's demonstration that upon the atomic scale there is discontinuity —nature does, in fact, operate by jumps. The principle of uniformity— which likewise was taken for granted in the nineteenth century—led to the wild-goose chase after mechanistic explanations of all phenomena, including those of life and consciousness—a chase of which physicists and biologists alike have begun to weary.<sup>1</sup>

Margenau remarks: "Characteristically, the proponents of the Unified Science movement picture science as a kind of surface, as a two-dimensional structure. They are fond of calling it a mosaic, a picture-puzzle into which the missing pieces must be skilfully fitted." He very rightly comments: "It will never do to picture science as a two-dimensional surface; by ignoring its depth, we falsify its nature." The Nature of Physical Reality (New York, 1950), p. 19.
