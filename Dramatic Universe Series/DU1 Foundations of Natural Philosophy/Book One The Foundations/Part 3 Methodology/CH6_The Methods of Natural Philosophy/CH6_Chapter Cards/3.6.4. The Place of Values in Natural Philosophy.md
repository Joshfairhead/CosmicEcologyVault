Addressing ourselves to the study of fact, we tend to assume that it is not legitimate to search for answers to the questions of 'whence', 'whither', or 'why'. This procedure proves to be convenient and effectual; but we must be on our guard against the fallacy of supposing that a true conclusion entails a valid premise. Fictitious and conventional distinctions can be useful as instruments, but their use is legitimate only so long as we keep clear of situations where they themselves enter into the subject-matter of our inquiry. The task of natural science is to deal with fact, and it is entitled to put aside questions of value; but this does not justify the denial that such questions are significant. 

We must be wary, however, when we set about circumscribing the field of our inquiry. By failure to pay attention to possible defects of language, we may overlook significant distinctions and so invalidate our findings. It may be easy to describe facts, for they lend themselves to classification in terms of observed regularities; but the very generality of some of our conclusions is deceptive, and we must understand why this should be so. The methods we commonly employ for dealing with facts are complicated, but on the whole they are successful. They all have one feature in common, namely, they start by eliminating distinctions that arise by way of consciousness. Such elimination is necessary, for without it we should be involved in contradictions, since there can be simultaneously present in our experience two different states of consciousness, each of which is aware of an apparently different set of facts. The resulting contradiction may take the form of inattentiveness, so that we do not notice that we are not doing what we intended to do. When such a situation arises in the course of a scientific experiment, we regard it as a failure and make a fresh start. Scientific observation and experiment, by which we seek to extend our knowledge of fact, are conducted on the assumption that everything has been done to minimize any effects that may be due to changes in the state of consciousness of the observer. Even the positive attitude towards consciousness as a factor in judgment is treated with suspicion by most scientists.<sup>1</sup> Even where subjective judgments are unavoidable, the influence of the state of consciousness is reduced as far as possible by multiplying observations and using the method of statistical reduction. 

When we pass from the general assessment of scientific data—that is, of facts—to the actual conduct of an experiment, we see that even the observation of phenomena is impossible without value judgments. A scientist wishes to establish facts and often claims that he does so without any judgment of value. This is self-deception, however, for success in scientific investigation depends upon choosing a field of experimentation likely to give interesting and 'valuable' results. Even when the experiment is decided upon and accurate observation becomes the principal aim of the worker, the separation between fact and value is still impossible—even in the very procedure that seeks to make it. When discordant observations—attributable to carelessness or faulty experimental procedure—are noted and set aside, he is making judgments of value and not of fact. Even in this negative sense, value is experienced as interest, curiosity, desire, and so forth. These impulses make themselves apparent through their influence upon our attention. We attend to what interests us and, in attending, our state of consciousness changes. In a wider sense, value is discovered when we can stand aside from the data of immediate sense-experience and survey the whole scene against past and future events. **In the highest sense of all value is experienced sub specie ceternitatis. For such a level of consciousness there is no separation of knowledge, judgment, and decision, and therefore it corresponds to the attainment of objective reason.** Our ordinary consciousness can only separate fact and value to the extent of its limited powers; it sees the phenomenal world only, and even that incompletely. 

Wholeness is relative. In our limited experiences we never find wholes that are perfectly integrated. Wholes are also structures, and we never find them complete. Because of imperfection and incompleteness, there is always an element of bewilderment in our attempts to make sense of the world about us. This bewilderment alternates with wonder and admiration as we discern beyond the immediate confusion the outlines of the universal pattern. **The bewilderment and the wonder are equally valid elements in our experience; they are like the poles of a magnet that serve to orientate us towards understanding.** From our experience of chaos and cosmos, we have to forge the instruments by which we can raise ourselves to the perspective of objective reason. There is nothing obligatory about such methods; for some purposes, and under some conditions, one method may prove more convenient than another. It will be found that the methods that are suitable for dealing with fact are, on the whole, inappropriate for the study of problems of value. The selection of methods sometimes can be subjective and even quite arbitrary, so that one which works well for one man will not suit another. Thus, although we can prescribe methods of procedure that will prove useful for our future inquiry, they must not be taken as either comprehensive or suitable for all purposes.

<sup>1</sup> Cf. R. G. Hopkinson, 'Factors Affecting Choice and Judgment', in Nature (1952), p. 556: "The attitude of the general science graduate to experiments involving subjective judgments is curious and illogical even if understandable. He is taught, throughout his study period, to believe that those things which he measures during the course of his 'practical work' are facts, inviolable and true. His faith in them transcends the faith of religion. Above all, he believes the dogma of Kelvin that we must measure in order to understand. He rarely succeeds in grasping the principle of uncertainty in physical measurement, and many years may pass before he realizes that all measurement demands a judgment on the compromise between accuracy and expediency. As a result, he dismisses all experiments which involve direct subjective judgment as being 'vague and inaccurate'. This dogmatic attitude is not confined to the young graduates."
