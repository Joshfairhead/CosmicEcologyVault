'Pure' knowledge divorced from being and will is an abstraction that has no place in any possible experience. A similitude of such 'pure' knowledge may be given by a well-arranged card-index, locked away in some cupboard and forgotten by its owner. Every concrete experience is a blending of function, being, and will; and if, for some reason, we need to study any one of the three separately, we can best do so by placing ourselves in a perspective that will reduce to a minimum the relative significance of the other two. When, for example, we concern ourselves with the problem of knowledge, we are almost bound to make a compromise that consists in separating the functional element in our experience and treating it as if it could exist by itself. For experience as seen from the perspective that minimizes the distinction of being and will, we shall use the term phenomenon.<sup>1</sup> Fact is then to be seen as the result of reducing phenomena to knowledge. The fact is thus, roughly speaking, all that we can know and the phenomenon is all that is present in a given state of consciousness. In order to 'know' what is present—the fact—it is necessary to eliminate from phenomena all non-functional elements. It follows, therefore, that the content of knowledge must be less than the content of phenomena.<sup>2</sup>

The reduction of phenomena to facts is an example of the method of progressive approximation, which alone is consistent with the retention of meanings. Phenomena are the raw material of knowledge. They include inner as well as outer experience, memories, mental associations, and the awareness of feelings and organic sensations. The unobservables that we can only infer from sense perceptions are no less phenomenal than the sights, sounds, and other impressions that relate us to material objects outside our own bodies. 

We have defined experience as the totality of the given, independent of any particular centre or state of consciousness. Phenomena are experience referred on to a specified mode of consciousness; namely, that of a normal human being. The phenomenal world is the world that presents itself to an ordinary man in his normal states of consciousness, prior to any discriminations of fact and value. By 'normal' is implied that we exclude hallucinations and fantastical inventions that are not susceptible of verification by observation or experiment. A 'normal state' is one that can be reproduced and studied and, where needful, measured and expressed in quantitative terms. 

<sup>1</sup> Kant's distinction of phenomenon and noumenon turns upon sensible and non-sensible intuition. This introduces a dualism that can scarcely be reconciled, for 'either sensible or non-sensible' seems to exclude any middle term. Nevertheless, Kant realized that the term 'noumenon' could be used in different ways. Subsequent interpretations have been concerned mainly with his negative doctrine of the thing "so far as it is not an object of our sensible intuition". He says, however, "but if we understand by it an object of a non-sensible intuition, we thereby presuppose a special mode of intuition, namely, the intellectual, which is not that which we possess, and of which we cannot comprehend even the possibility. This would be 'noumenon' in the negative sense of the term" {Critique of Pure Reason, p. 268). 

<sup>2</sup> The mundus sensibilis—if by this we understand the whole that is given in immediate experience—is richer than the mundus intelligibilis—if by this we mean that which is given coram intuitu intellectuali, for our intellectual intuition is, in the Kantian sense, subject to the categories. On the other hand, the noumenon in what Kant calls "the positive sense of the term" is more than that which is given in immediate experience, for it is not subject to the limitations of the particular form of consciousness present.]
