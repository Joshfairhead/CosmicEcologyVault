All that can be known is fact. Not all facts are possible. For example, pouring a quart of liquid out of a pint bottle is an impossible fact. We may make three statements: 

(a) 'Mount Everest is in this room'
(b) 'a red cow is in this room', and 
(c) 'a chair is in this room'. 

The first is impossible; the second is possible but not actual; the third is both possible and actual. To distinguish between these and similar cases, we shall use the following definitions: 

(i) A situation is a fact taken without reference to its actual or possible arising. 
(ii) An occasion is a possible situation, potential or actual, 
(iii) An actualization is an occasion accessible to sense perception. 

Every actualization occupies a definite segment of the spatio-temporal world of our sense-experience, and all phenomena are referred to some centre of consciousness. An occasion that is actual for one consciousness may be not-actual for another. For example, tomorrow's sunrise is not actual for my present consciousness, but it will be actual for a consciousness that observes the phenomenon tomorrow. 

**The term determining-condition designates the factor by which possible situations are distinguished from impossible**. Determining-conditions are independent of actualization, and must therefore have universal validity. On the other hand, they cannot have absolute validity, since they depend upon being which is relative. If the determining-conditions had an absolute character, then statements about fact could be either wholly true or wholly false; but experience teaches us that this is not the case, and that it is always necessary to insert qualifications that give every statement about fact the character of being 'more or less true'. 

Many statements of fact can be so nearly true that the 'more or less' can be disregarded, as in the example of the transfer of heat from a cold to a hot body. This close approximation to truth has an important historical consequence, for it means that in the early stages of scientific discovery the quest for absolute truth often appeared to be both possible and legitimate. Hence, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the aim of science was to discover universal laws that were absolutely true and therefore applicable to all possible situations. It was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the refinement of scientific techniques began to force a far-reaching change of attitude, with the result that in the twentieth century natural scientists have almost entirely abandoned the search for 'absolute laws of nature'. 

Once again the relativity of being imposes itself, even where our attention is directed exclusively to the functional element in reality. This is, however, not the only obstacle we encounter in our endeavour to formulate the significance of the rules which govern phenomena. The problem remains obscure if, having taken the relativity of being into account, we still fail to distinguish between function and will. It must be stressed that the regularities of function are of a different character from the conditions that determine the possibility or impossibility of a particular pattern of events. 

Let us now consider the statement 'the cow in that field is eating grass'. In an obvious sense the proposition is either true or false according to whether or not a cow 'exists' within the phenomenal situation presented to our common awareness. Here both truth or falsity and possibility or impossibility refer to the presence or absence at a given moment of an object that corresponds to our use of the word 'cow'. There is, in addition, a necessary qualification connected with existence. In making this assertion, we imply that we are referring to a 'real-life' cow. It would not be possible or true if the cow were there but dead, or if it were a china cow standing upon a shelf. If the sentence is to have the meaning we intend, the cow must exist as a living animal. If we were to say: 'There is a right-angled triangle, the sides of which stand in the ratio of 3:4:5', anyone acquainted with the laws of geometry would agree that this not only refers to a possible situation but is also a true proposition. In any discussion of this proposition, truth and falsity, possibility and impossibility, would have a different significance from that which applies to the proposition 'the cow in that field is eating grass'.

Let us now consider the statement: 'There is a round square.' Here the truth or falsity of the proposition does not turn upon any particular phenomenon, for nothing is said about where or when the round square is to be found. We should be inclined to say that the proposition is false and impossible because it is self-contradictory. It is, nevertheless, possible to define a plane figure as follows: 

(a) it has a centre; 
(b) it has four straight sides, equal and perpendicular in pairs; and  
(c) every point in the figure is at an equal distance—called the radius —from the centre. 

Such a figure would indeed be a round square, and not only is there no logical contradiction in the definition, but it could exist in Euclidean space, provided that the radius were infinite. If we now try to verify the proposition experimentally by constructing it with ruler and compass, we must fail, since there are no infinite phenomena. We thus reach the conclusion that the proposition 'there is a round square' can never correspond to any fact, and we find also that the impossibility of a round square has nothing to do with existence but only with framework.<sup>1</sup> 

It must be noted further that framework impossibility includes but goes beyond logical impossibility. The statement 'yesterday's sun will rise tomorrow' can be construed as a false proposition by definition of yesterday and tomorrow, but there is certainly something more than a logical contradiction that makes us reject it. On the other hand, its impossibility is only relative to our own form of consciousness. There is nothing logically impossible about a state of consciousness that would be capable of experiencing yesterday's sunrise tomorrow in exactly the same way as it was experienced yesterday.

Discussion of these examples shows that, although given in experience, framework is neither what things do nor what they are, but the form in which—being what they are—they do what they do. That Kant was wrong in thinking that our intuitions of space and time were given a priori became evident with the development of non-Euclidean geometries. Space, time, eternity, and hyparxis are not transcendental—that is, prior to phenomena—for they arise in the no-man's-land between phenomena and fact. Though prior to facts, they are derivative from phenomena, and we discover in experience the universal forms of all possible phenomena. **The word 'nature', as commonly used, signifies the world of phenomena, and therefore framework comprises all that we can know of 'the laws of nature'**.<sup>2</sup>+ 

In the twentieth century, philosophy has begun to recognize that **the laws of nature cannot be formulated a priori, but are discovered progressively by observation and reflection.** Logical consistency, which eighteenth-century philosophers supposed to be the test of truth, proves to have no application at all to fact. 

It is always possible to construct alternative sets of rules, any one of which is more or less convenient for reducing phenomena to facts, and yet they may be quite incompatible with one another. Reichenbach's scheme for a philosophy of quantum mechanics illustrates this point. He formulates a set of rules for assessing truth-values of propositions about the existence of waves and particles; and about the mechanism of diffraction, and the emission and absorption of quanta—that differ from those of ordinary logic by restricting the validity of the law of excluded middle. In this way he and other scientific philosophers came close to recognizing the character of the conditions by which possible situations can be distinguished and determined.<sup>3</sup>

Here it is worth making a verbal distinction, that is also of practical value, between rules that we formulate for ourselves in the light of our present comprehension of the laws for which we are searching. Rules are no more than formulae, the value of which is to be assessed only in terms of their pragmatic effectiveness. Laws are the statement of objective regularities that are presumed to be independent of our search and of its success or failure. The laws of framework prescribe the general conditions which make it possible for situations to enter experience. Rules tell us whether a given situation can be an occasion.

Marvin Farber, The Foundations of Phenomenology, p. 232: "To say that expressions like 'round square' are senseless is to confuse meaninglessness with the a priori impossibility of fulfilling meaning." Husserl's distinction between 'fulfilling meaning' and 'content as an object' can be understood as the distinction between framework conditions and existential assertion.

Whitehead, The Concept of Nature, Camb. 1920, p. 187 : "We observe nature as extended in an immediate present which is simultaneous but not instantaneous, and therefore the whole, which is immediately discerned or signified as an interrelated system, forms a stratification of nature which is a physical fact."
