Clarification of the role of the framework determining-conditions can be accomplished by regarding phenomena from four aspects, differing in the significance accorded to existence and mechanism in the study of each. We can study phenomena with special reference to existence, and particularly to the different levels of existence that we find in our experience. The determining-condition that is especially relevant for such study we may call eternity. **If we take existence and behaviour together, we can speak of time as the determining-condition that sets existence against the background of behaviour, and of space as that which sets behaviour against the background of existence.** **The connection between this interpretation and that of Kant can be seen if we remember that existence is experienced as consciousness—that is, 'inner intuition', and behaviour as knowledge—that is, 'outer intuition'. Laws from which both behaviour and existence can be abstracted are those of pure will. They correspond to the conditions already designated by the word hyparxis.** The laws of hyparxis include such abstract forms as classification and logic, but they also include the determination of 'ableness-to-be' that belongs to will. 

The grouping of framework laws under the four headings of eternity, time, space, and hyparxis is appropriate for phenomena. For higher levels of consciousness, time, hyparxis, and eternity become merged, and the separations of space also assume a quite different character from those of our usual experience. Consequently, the partition between the four groups of laws is sharp only in the domain of inanimate objects. 

We can therefore best discover the character of the laws by the study of the physical and dynamical sciences. In this connection it must be noted that the words 'eternity', 'time', 'space', and 'hyparxis' do not signify in the same way as most words of our language. All 'parts of speech' stand for things and attributes and processes. More rarely, and usually without fully recognizing their character, we use words to indicate levels of being. In the English language suffixes such as -hood, -ity, -ness often give some indication of being; as when we refer to 'thinghood', manhood', 'animality', 'deity', 'happiness', 'consciousness', and so on. 'Space' and 'hyparxis' are not words of either kind, for they signify neither what anything is nor what it does.<sup>1</sup> The former is the outer and the latter is the inner condition of 'being what one is'. 

The framework determining-conditions are not known in the way that we know function, and we are not conscious of them in the way we experience being. Nevertheless, all our experience is pervaded by them; their essential character is as familiar to the savage or to the idiot, as it is to the scientist or to the philosopher. The only difference is that the latter seeks to formulate in words his intuition of their nature. By making use of the term 'determining-conditions' we indicate what framework signifies; but a fuller and more definite account can be given by defining framework as the self-limitation of will in respect of the non-arbitrariness of the existing universe. The equivalence of this definition and that given at the head of the section cannot be demonstrated as fact; but it plays an important part in our intuition of values. 

The four sets of determining-conditions are inseparable. We cannot think of time apart from space. The two can be separately represented in a mathematical symbolism, but they cannot be discovered as separable constituents of any possible experience. The same is true of hyparxis. **Hyparxis is recurrent; there are no non-recurrent occasions**, nor can we enumerate except in terms of recurrent situations. We can establish also that eternity is involved in every phenomenon as the source of its potential. It is only for our specialized form of consciousness that the determining-conditions appear to be separate. Since, however, we are concerned here with phenomena—that is, the content of experience on our usual level of consciousness—the four determining-conditions can be clarified with the help of rules which can be summarized and set down more or less independently, as follows: 

(i) Space: Rules setting behaviour against the background of existence; that is, the outer relationships of wholes.
(ii) Time: Rules setting existence against the background of behaviour; that is, the inner aspect of function. 
(iii) Eternity: Rules having reference to existence and particularly to different levels of existence that we find in our experience. Hence these are largely concerned with consciousness. 
(iv) Hyparxis: Rules from which both behaviour and existence can be abstracted—that is, those that determine the manifestations of will possible in a given situation. 

The saying of St. Augustine in regard to time—si non rogas intelligo —applies to all four determining-conditions.<sup>2</sup> The framework determining-conditions as applied to universal existence are beyond our understanding. We can study them only as they apply to limited wholes— ourselves included. We enter into situations always with the distinction of inner and outer—of subjective experience and objective experience. Knowledge of the determining conditions enables us to prescribe what is possible and what impossible in such situations, and this implies that there always must be, for our experience, a distinction of inner and outer, corresponding to the different character of the triad time—eternity— hyparxis, as compared with the space-like triad length—breadth— depth. The first refers to the condition of internal possibility and the second to the external possibility of a given actualization. **Time, eternity, and hyparxis are conditions of being what one is, whereas space is the condition of not being what one is not. The first three are inner conditions and they are intrinsically similar in character in so far as they do not relate. Space is an outer condition and its chief significance is in relations.**
