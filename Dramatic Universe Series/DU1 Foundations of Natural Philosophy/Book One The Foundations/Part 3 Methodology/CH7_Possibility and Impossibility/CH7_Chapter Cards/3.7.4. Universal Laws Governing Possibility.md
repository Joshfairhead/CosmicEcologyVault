Our grasp of the determining conditions develops in quite a different way. We understand them more readily than we know them. They are obvious and yet so profound that we can never exhaust their meaning. They pervade all experience, moulding it inevitably according to their own laws. Kant rightly saw time as the form in which our inner state is intuited; but he discarded as irrelevant the tricks played upon our experience of time by modifications in our state of consciousness. We are subject both to illusion and hallucination, but these concern existence rather than the form of our experience. A mirage in the desert is actualized successively in time in the same way as the perception of a real oasis. The psychological experience of timelessness—of standing still in the present moment—can be recognized as authentic, although it cannot be measured with a clock. The division of attention in which we can observe our own functions is also an authentic change in our relationship to time. Such considerations confirm the view that we can extend the application of the determining-conditions beyond commonplace phenomena, but are a warning that their significance does not remain constant in passing from one level to another. 

Our intuition of the universal framework is in marked contrast with the instability of functional generalization. The very form of our language, the origins of which are lost in the remote past, is already expressive of the framework laws. We think and we speak in the form prescribed by our own intuitions of space and time, and it is not surprising that some philosophers have concluded that these are given to us even before we begin to think. Strictly speaking, this is true—if by 'thought' we mean the process by which phenomena are related to facts, but we must not make the mistake of confusing thoughts about phenomena with phenomena themselves. It is in the latter that the laws of framework are exemplified, and that is why these laws—even if not specifically formulated—are part of the common heritage of all mankind. They are the consequence of our perceiving reality from a certain stratum of consciousness.

The first task of the natural philosopher should be to formulate the laws of framework as clearly and comprehensively as possible. If he fails to do so and plunges directly into the subsequent stages of searching for regularities of function, he places an almost insurmountable barrier against bringing these secondary regularities into a coherent and complete structure. We cannot dispense with the discipline of clarification, but our aim will not be achieved if clarity is gained at the expense of applicability. This happens, for example, when formal logic is systemized by separating the study of forms from the study of phenomena. True logic must take into account the element of vagueness that is always present in our experience.<sup>1</sup>

We have to examine, therefore, the status of such vague propositions as 'the patch was more or less yellow'. We can see that in this case the rule of excluded middle does not apply, since the proposition can only be more or less true. The rule of excluded middle is valid only for propositions about wholes, and it amounts to a convention that whenever a whole is named it will be treated as though it were an individual. If we penetrate more deeply into our experience, we find ourselves ultimately confronted by complex structures with all their uncertainties and incompletenesses. We therefore can answer the question, 'Are there alternative logics ?' by saying that **there are as many logics as there are fundamental categories of our experience**. There is the two-term logic of wholes and polarity, the three-term logic of the triad, and so on. 

Propositions escape from the law of excluded middle, not only by reason of vagueness, but also when they refer to unactualized occasions. If I say 'today it will rain', the truth or falsity of the sentence is projected into the future. Tonight the sentence 'it has rained today' will have become a proposition about an actualization, and therefore will be either true or false. All that can be asserted in the first case is that there is a greater or less probability that tonight the latter proposition will be true or false. **Taking the view, as we must, that future occasions are no less part of our experience than present or past occasions, then we must admit probability as part of the framework of phenomena.** We thus find how to reconcile the fiducial and confidence theories of probability. 

Let us suppose that at a given moment it is a fact that I have just thrown a hundred coins and that fifty-one have turned up heads. I am now in the act of tossing a second hundred, and am again obtaining an approximate equality. I intend to toss a third hundred, and I expect that out of the totality of three hundred very nearly half will be heads. Regularities of this kind have nothing to do with behaviour and existence. An unlimited variety of experiments could be devised in which the laws of probability would be exemplified similarly. In such experiments, almost every stratum of existence could be explored and almost every kind of functional activity used. The only condition that would have to be fulfilled would be that a certain pattern of probability should operate—one that is not in time nor in space; for it is independent of actualization or non-actualization. This pattern discloses two sets of conditions: one set determines the potentialities of the situation, and the other the frequency with which a particular potentiality will be actualized. These two sets of conditions are independent of both existence and behaviour and yet both are universal; for no situation is fully determined without reference to its potentialities and their likelihood of occurrence.

Writing of vague propositions, Waisman remarks that "this sounds as if reality could decide which logic was valid, as though the structure of logic reflected the framework of being". Although Waisman rejects this conclusion, it is the correct one if the words 'reality' and 'being' are taken to mean the content of experience.
