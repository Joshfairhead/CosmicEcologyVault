We use the word 'impossible' in various ways. In logical usage it refers to some or other convention regarding the meaning of words. For example, we may say 'it is impossible for a door to be both open and shut at the same time'. This statement is only true if we agree either to exclude from consideration such statements as 'the door is ajar', or to assign conventionally to the word 'ajar' one of the two meanings 'open' or 'shut'. **Thus logical impossibility depends solely upon the manner in which we define the meanings of words.** This applies also to such paradoxes as Zeno's dictum, 'it is impossible to step into the same river twice'. We may agree that the study of paradoxes such as this is useful as a training in the right use of all language, but we cannot feel that it helps us to a better understanding of experience. 

If we say 'it is impossible for two and two to make five', we affirm something that goes beyond the meaning of the words 'two' and 'five'. To see the truth of this assertion, we must have an adequate idea of the significance of numbers; but it does not depend upon definition alone, as was the case in the previous examples, for it also tells us something of the relationship of classes that goes beyond the compass of language. Again, if we say that it is impossible for water to run uphill, we are making an assertion the meaning of which is only clear with considerable knowledge of the physical world; but, when this meaning is grasped, it serves to tell us something of fundamental importance about the nature of time and existence. Nevertheless, a statement is neither meaningful nor true unless it is placed in the right context. For example, water in a siphon will run uphill—but only to a height of some thirty feet—whereas water forced into a pipe-line by a powerful pump will flow uphill to a very great height. In so far as we have knowledge of the physical world, we recognize the meaning of these statements, and also of the limits within which they are true or false. Nevertheless, we rightly use the word 'impossible' in such statements as 'it is impossible on the earth to raise water over thirty-two feet with a suction-pump'. 

We are accustomed to make a distinction between 'logical' and 'physical' impossibility. It is held by many that physical impossibility really means 'improbability so great that the occurrence of the event will not be observed in finite time'. It is, for example, well known from the laws of heat transfer that when a hot and a cold body are placed in contact, heat is invariably observed to flow from the hot body to the cold. Since, however, this flow depends upon random molecular motions, it is always possible for a high-energy molecule to pass from a cold region to a hot one. A positive flow of heat against the temperature gradient is thus 'possible', though never observed in large systems. It would appear, therefore, that the word 'impossible' is wrongly used in formulating the law of heat transfer. Nevertheless, the meaning is clear and unambiguous if we assert that it is 'impossible for the improbable to be probable', in which case 'impossible' must always have the logical meaning conveyed by 'it is impossible for both probable and not-probable to be true'. The assertion about heat transfer can thus be written, 'it is impossible that A is a probable event and A is an improbable event can both be true'. The truth value of a statement cannot be assessed unless we know what the statement means, and therefore **all statements about possibilities and impossibilities turn upon meanings, and these in turn arise from the recognition of recurrent elements in experience.**

In order to remove all doubts as to the legitimacy of using the word 'impossible' to signify the fact that experience excludes certain events, we may consider the assertion, 'it is impossible that yesterday's sunrise will occur tomorrow'. According to the natural meaning of the words 'yesterday' and 'tomorrow', this statement can be considered as a logical impossibility; but we take it—and rightly so—as a statement about experience that tells us something very significant about temporal actualization. Similarly, if the schoolboy says 'five into four will not go', he is asserting something that is not only logically true—that is, tauto-logous—but physically significant—as he finds when he attempts to share four marbles among five boys. **We shall, therefore, use the term 'impossible' in this discussion to signify 'excluded from experience'.** 

We must note here the distinction also required between 'possible' and 'potential'. That which is potential exists no less than that which is actual. For example, we speak of potential and kinetic energy, and in doing so we imply both existence and the possibility of actualization. But when we speak of a possible event, we do not necessarily imply that the existential content required for subsequent actualization is present. We may say 'it is possible to make hay while the sun shines', but this does not tell the hearer whether conditions for hay-making are present or not. On the other hand, if we say that 'the potential hay production of England is three million tons', we refer to something that exists even though no one has ever seen or touched it. Thus 'possible' tells us that universal laws—such as those of logic and physics—are not violated; while 'potential' tells us that something exists in a non-actualized form. **Moreover, we can readily see that what is potential must be possible, but what is possible is not necessarily potential**.
