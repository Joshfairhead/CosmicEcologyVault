A law can be called universal only if we never fail to find it exemplified in any situation to which it could apply. We observe only actual occasions, but we need a test of possibility that can be applied to occasions that do not become actual. For example, a physicist requires to allow for the presence in an atom of non-radiating electrons. In this state the electron does not become actual, and it cannot even be asserted to be present in space and time. We should, nevertheless, say that it is 'impossible' that it should disappear altogether, since we infer its presence from the neutrality of the atom and, possibly, also from its mass. In this way we are able to make confident statements about an occasion that cannot be located in space and time. We do so because we regard the laws of conservation of energy, momentum, and electric charge as having universal validity, whether in a particular instance we can verify them or not.

**Phenomena are not identical with events in time and space. They have a coherence that we discover when we examine them from the standpoint of universal similarity.** This similarity concerns the different ways in which phenomena can be classified, and also the connection that can be found between the classes. The rules that govern these operations have the same kind of significance as those that determine permissible and non-permissible arrangements in space and successiveness in time; they have been formulated by way of logic and arithmetic. In the past, logic was regarded as consisting of rules of thought given a priori—that is, as the form of thought in general—but now is seen to be concerned with a special kind of fact; namely, fact from which existence has been eliminated.* 

There is a branch of logic that is concerned with the right use of language, but even this must appeal to experience for its justification. True logic is the search for laws that determine the form of phenomena without reference to actualization in space and time, and without distinction of actual and potential. The laws of arithmetic have the same kind of significance as those of geometry and dynamics. All consist of propositions that have universal validity for phenomena, and are therefore implied in all statements about fact. 

The task of the logician and the mathematician is to bring clarity and coherence into the discoveries that we all make, even without noticing them, about the form of all possible situations; that is, about framework.<sup>2</sup> In this respect the determining-conditions of framework differ from the generalizations of natural science. The latter claim neither universal validity nor permanent significance. They are provisional statements of regularities that are found in the mechanisms that operate in the different strata of existence. Great ingenuity is required for the discovery and formulation of these regularities. They have to be dissected out of the seething mass of events that proceed simultaneously upon many different levels. Consequently, consistency and coherence can only be obtained at the expense of comprehensiveness and precision. Thus these generalizations present an ever-changing picture—sometimes gaining in breadth and losing in precision; sometimes coming into focus, but only within a restricted domain.

<sup>2</sup> Husserl came very close to seeing the character of the determining-conditions, but he sought to reduce them all to pure logic. Farber (loc. cit., pp. 144-5) writes: "Space, conceived as the form of order of the world of appearance, is distinguished from space in the sense of a formally defined manifold. ... If by space is meant the categorical form of world-space, then it comes under the genus of pure—categorically determined —manifold."]
