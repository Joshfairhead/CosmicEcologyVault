The basic dynamical experiment—the two fundamental directions of time and eternity—the fact of eternity-blindness—unobservable constraints—accelerations as displacements in eternity—unified field theory in five dimensions. (cf. also Appendix to Chapter 14, p. 499, 'Unified Field Theory—Simplified Mathematical Treatment'.)
