Distribution of variations—lack of evidence that the new eternal pattern can arise through mutation and selection—observed variability ascribed to hyparchic regulator—the species as a conscious individual—discussion of objections—taxonomy and the patterns of organic life—inadequacy of ordinary mutations—Goldschmidt, Haldane, and Fisher—origin of species neither causal nor purposive but regulative—taxonomic criteria—the hyparchic regulator of biosphere true source of ecological order—organic excitability—arising of species illustrated by Crataegus—mechanism of speciation and the formation of new genera—synthesis of species Galeopsis tetrahit—three factors.
