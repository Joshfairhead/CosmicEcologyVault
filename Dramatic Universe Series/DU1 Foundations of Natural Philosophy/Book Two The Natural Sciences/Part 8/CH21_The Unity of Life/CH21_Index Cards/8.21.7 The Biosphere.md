Life on earth recurrent series of biospheric existences—the biosphere as higher gradation of true individuality—exemplifies trimorphic octopotence—orthogenesis as biospheric counterpart of epigenesis in the organism—the eternal pattern of separate genera derived from general pattern of the biosphere—Suss, Vernadsky, Goldschmidt and Vinogradov—the analogy of the biosphere and the colloids—both two-dimensional—the biosphere as transition from autonomic to hypernomic existence—role of the biosphere in the earth's history—the concentrations of the elements—transformations of energy—the biosphere related to the sun and moon—the time cycles of the biosphere—the dominant forms of life in each biospheric cycle—the consciousness of the orthogenetic factor.
