Irreversibility as universal property—the universal decay constant—non-degenerative entities have perfect regenerative ratio between potentiality and actualization—the exact regenerative ratio R defined—the hypothesis of temporal equivalence—the ratio between dynamical and thermo-dynamical measures of time—evaluation of R—discloses connection with the fine structure constant of atomic spectra—R as a measure of ableness-to-be—Eddington's deduction of x.
