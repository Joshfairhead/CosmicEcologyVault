The power to see 'how' and 'why' as a single question. The subjective aspect of Will.
- The subjective aspect of [[will]] forming a triad with [[being]] and [[knowing]]. The word is always used in a positive sense. 

**DU1**: 
- To Understand is to recognise relational qualities. 
- Knowledge is functional. Being is mysterious. Understanding is neither. 
- It is a Power found in attention, choice, and decision. 
- For example, it is recognisable in self-situation-choice systems – ‘who’ we are doing the ‘right’ thing as a result of understanding! This is why it is needed. 
- **"Man can have no will of his own until through understanding, he has brought his powers into an inner relationship that can respond to the various manifestations of the Triad".** 
- This ‘purifies the intellect’. Understanding is therefore to perceive triadic relationships (and not just in the mind!). This comes about through the reconciling power of God.
