"The store house of potentialities". One of the four determining conditions together with [[space]], [[time]] and [[hyparxis]]. Eternity is the measure of [[intensity]] of [[being]]. Represented by an [[alpha-pencil]].

The condition of existing in a state of potentiality. The locus of the essential patterns of living beings. Eternity not perceived directly; hence man is said to be "eternity-blind".

BLINDNESS. The property of human sense perceptions which permits them to experience only actualisations and not potentialities.
