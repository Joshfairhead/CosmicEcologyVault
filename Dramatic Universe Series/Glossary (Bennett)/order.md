Property of the tetrad as system of ordering activity. Man by his demiurgic nature, is destined to raise the level of [[order]] in his environment. Ordering is also one of the six fundamental operations of the [[will]]. (See also: [[laws]])
- The [[compresence]] of compatible elements. The eternal component of any present moment. There are "orders of order". Increase of order is a criterion of [[progress]]. 
- Order is more concrete than relatedness because we need to state the existential conditions. Order is a series of energies: each is an element in the totality of existing situations.
