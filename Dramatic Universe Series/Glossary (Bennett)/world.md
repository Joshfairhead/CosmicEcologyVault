The totality of situations determined by one of the great levels of [[being]] and associated with corresponding limitations of [[will]]. Seven worlds are significant for human experience. The worlds are designated by Roman numerals, thus: World I, or the [[transfinite]] undivided [[will]]; World III, [[will]] as a [[triad]] without the limitations of existence; World VI as six fundamental laws; World XII, [[will]] as [[individuality]]; World XXIV, [[will]] associated with selfhood; World XLVIII, [[will]] subject to exclusion and therefore dependent; World XCVI, [[will]] subject to negative and therefore null-triads; and , finally, the material world, which itself comprises many levels. 
- Any totality studied primarily as the environment in which a system or systems is able to exist and develop. Also the totality of a particular kind of element, thus the "world of energy"
