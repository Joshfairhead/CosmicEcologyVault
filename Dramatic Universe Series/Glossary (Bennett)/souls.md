The operations of the [[will]] that are wholly reactional - balanced between [[attraction]] and [[repulsion]] - can produce a crystallisation of soul-stuff that is wholly dependent on external stimulation, in the absonce of which all experience is then subjective or "dream-like". This is called the null soul. Its state may be blissful or wretched according to the quality of its reactions, but it has no freedom of will.
