Also [[past]] and [[present]]. A region of [[Dramatic Universe Series/Glossary (Bennett)/experience]] in which the [[will]] is free from the limitations of[[existence]] and yet can operate to produce [[transformation]]. Has the characteristic of the [[future]], except that it is free from all predetermination. Equated with the "Kingdom of Heaven". The same condition can also be experienced within the present moment (ecstasy or transformation) and can remain in the [[past]] (the living past).
